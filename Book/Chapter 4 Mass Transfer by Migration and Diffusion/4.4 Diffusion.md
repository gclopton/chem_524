# 4.4 Diffusion

As we have just seen, one can restrict the mass transfer of an electroactive species near the electrode to the diffusive mode by using a supporting electrolyte and operating in a quiescent solution. Most electrochemical methods are built on the assumption that such conditions prevail; therefore, diffusion is a process of central importance. We now take a closer look at this phenomenon and the mathematical models describing it (13-17).

## 4.4.1 A Microscopic View

Diffusion works toward the homogenization of a mixture by a "random walk" process, which can be readily understood through a one-dimensional case. Consider a single solute molecule constrained to a linear path and buffeted by solvent molecules undergoing Brownian motion. The solute molecule moves randomly forward and backward in steps of length, $l$, with one step being made per unit time, $\tau$. We can ask, "Where will the molecule be after a time, $t$ ?" However, we can answer only by giving the probability that the molecule will be found at different locations. Equivalently, we can envision a large number of molecules concentrated in a line at $t=0$ and ask what the distribution of molecules will be at time $t$.

This is sometimes called the "drunken sailor problem," in which a very drunk sailor emerges from a bar (Figure 4.4.1) and staggers randomly along the sidewalk, taking a step of size $l$ every $\tau$ seconds. What is the probability that the sailor will get down the street a certain distance after time $t$ ?

In a random walk, all paths that can be traversed in any elapsed period are equally likely; hence, the probability that a molecule (or sailor) has arrived at any given point is simply the number of paths leading to that point divided by the total of paths to all accessible points. This idea is developed in Figure 4.4.2. At time $\tau$, it is equally likely that the molecule is at $+l$ and $-l$; and at time $2 \tau$, the relative probabilities of being at $+2 l, 0$, and $-2 l$, are 1,2 , and 1 , respectively. In general, the probability, $P(m, r)$, that the molecule is at a particular location after $m$ time units ( $m=t / \tau$ ) is given by the binomial coefficient,

$$
\begin{equation*}
P(m, r)=\frac{m!}{r!(m-r)!}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{m} \tag{4.4.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the set of locations is defined by $x=(-m+2 r) l$, with $r=0,1, \ldots m$.
The mean square displacement of the molecule, $\overline{\Delta^{2}}$, can be calculated by summing the squares of the displacements achieved with each path, then dividing by the total number of paths ( $2^{m}$ ). The squares of the displacements are used (just as when one obtains the standard deviation in statistics) because movement is possible in both the positive and negative directions, and the sum of the displacements is always zero. This procedure is shown in Table 4.4.1.

(a) $l=$ step size, $1 / \tau=$ step frequency, $t=m \tau=$ time interval.
(b) $n=$ total number of possibilities.
(c) $\Delta=$ possible positions; relative probabilities are parenthesized.

In general, $\overline{\Delta^{2}}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\overline{\Delta^{2}}=m l^{2}=\frac{t}{\tau} l^{2}=2 D t \tag{4.4.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the diffusion coefficient, $D$, identified by Einstein $(18,19)$ as $l^{2} / 2 \tau$, is a constant related to the step size and step frequency. ${ }^{8}$ It has units of length ${ }^{2}$ /time, usually $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$.

[^5]The root-mean-square displacement at time $t$ (often called the diffusion length) is, therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\Delta}=(2 D t)^{1 / 2} \tag{4.4.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation provides a handy rule of thumb for estimating the distance affected by a diffusion process (e.g., how far product molecules have moved, on the average, from an electrode in a certain time). A typical value of $D$ for aqueous solutions is $5 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$; hence, a diffusion layer on the order of $10^{-4} \mathrm{~cm}$ is built up in 1 ms (or $10^{-3} \mathrm{~cm}$ in 0.1 s , or $10^{-2} \mathrm{~cm}$ in 10 s ). [Section 6.1.1(c).]

As $m$ becomes large, (4.4.1) takes on a continuous form. For $N_{0}$ molecules located at the origin at $t=0$, a Gaussian curve describes the distribution at a later time, $t$. The number of molecules, $N(x, t)$, in a segment $\Delta x$ wide centered on position $x$ is (21)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{N(x, t)}{N_{0}}=\frac{\Delta x}{2(\pi D t)^{1 / 2}} \exp \left(\frac{-x^{2}}{4 D t}\right) \tag{4.4.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

A similar treatment can be applied to two- and three-dimensional random walks, where the root-mean-square displacements are $(4 D t)^{1 / 2}$ and $(6 D t)^{1 / 2}$, respectively $(17,22)$.

The diffusion coefficient can be usefully related to the solution viscosity, $\eta$ by inserting the definition of ionic mobility, (2.3.9), into the Nernst-Einstein equation, (4.1.11). The result is the Stokes-Einstein equation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{\mathrm{j}}=k T / 6 \pi \eta r \tag{4.4.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $r$ is the radius of the diffusing species. Although the derivation just described is constructed on ionic mobility, the result does not depend on charge; thus, the equation is not limited to ions, but also applies to neutral species.

A more molecular picture of diffusion emerges by considering the concepts of molecular and diffusional velocity (22). In a Maxwellian gas, a particle of mass, $m$, and average one-dimensional velocity, $v_{\mathrm{x}}$, has an average kinetic energy of $1 / 2 m v_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}$. This energy can also be shown to be $k T / 2(23,24)$; thus, the average instantaneous molecular velocity is $v_{\mathrm{x}}=(k T / m)^{1 / 2}$. For an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule ( $m=5 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~g}$ ) at 300 K , one finds that $v_{\mathrm{x}}=3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$; however, an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule can make progress in a given direction at this high velocity only over a short distance before it collides with another molecule and changes direction. The net movement by the random walk resulting from repeated collisions is much slower than $v_{\mathrm{x}}$ and is governed by the process described above. In a liquid solution, a velocity distribution similar to that of a Maxwellian gas applies, but the distance traveled between collisions is much shorter than in the gas phase; thus, the net movement by a random walk in solution is much slower in the liquid. Values of $D$ in liquids are typically 10,000 times smaller than in the gas phase.

A "diffusional velocity," $v_{\mathrm{d}}$, can be extracted from (4.4.3) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{d}}=\bar{\Delta} / t=(2 D / t)^{1 / 2} \tag{4.4.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Care must be used in interpreting (4.4.6) as a true velocity, because there is a time dependence in $v_{d}$ arising from the random walk's tendency to favor small displacements from a starting point vs. large ones. Values of $v_{\mathrm{d}}$ based on accessible experimental measurements of $\Delta$ and $t$ are generally much smaller than the instantaneous molecular velocity, $v_{\mathrm{x}}$. For a typical value of $D\left(5 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right.$ in water $), v_{\mathrm{d}}$ is $3,0.1$, and $0.003 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$ at $t=1 \mu \mathrm{~s}, 1 \mathrm{~ms}$, and 1 s , respectively.

The relative importance of migration and diffusion can be gauged by comparing $v_{\mathrm{d}}$ with the steady-state migrational velocity, $v$, for an ion of mobility $u_{j}$ in an electric field (Section 2.3.3).

By definition, $v=u_{j} \mathcal{E}$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is the electric field strength felt by the ion. From the Nernst-Einstein equation, (4.1.11),

$$
\begin{equation*}
v=\left|z_{j}\right| F D_{j} \mathcal{E} / R T \tag{4.4.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

When $v \ll v_{\mathrm{d}}$ for a given species, diffusion dominates over migration at a given position and time. From (4.4.6) and (4.4.7), we find that this condition can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(2 D_{j} t\right)^{1 / 2} \mathcal{E} \ll \frac{2 R T}{\left|z_{j}\right| F} \tag{4.4.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

The left side is the diffusion length times the field strength, which is the voltage drop in the solution over the length scale of diffusion. To ensure that migration is negligible compared to diffusion, this voltage drop must be smaller than about $2 R T /\left|z_{j}\right| F$, which is $51.4 /\left|z_{j}\right| \mathrm{mV}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This is the same as saying that for migration to be neglected, the difference in electrical potential energy for the diffusing ion must be smaller than a few $k T$ over the length scale of diffusion (typically $1-100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in electrochemical experiments).

## 4.4.2 Fick's Laws of Diffusion

Fick's laws (1) are differential equations describing the flux of a substance and its concentration as functions of time and position. In this section, we will derive them for linear (one-dimensional) diffusion and will extend the results to other geometries.

The flux of a species, O , written as $J_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)$, is the number of moles of O that pass location $x$ per second per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ of area normal to the axis of diffusion. The flux at $x$ may vary with time; therefore, $t$ is explicitly recognized in the function. Fick's first law states that the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient, $\partial C_{\mathrm{O}} / \partial x$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)=-D_{\mathrm{O}} \frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial x} \tag{4.4.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation was originally postulated by Fick (1), but it can be derived from the microscopic model by an argument originally due to Einstein (19, 25). Assume that at time $t, N_{\mathrm{O}}(x)$ molecules are immediately to left of $x$ and $N_{\mathrm{O}}(x+\Delta x)$ molecules are immediately to the right (Figure 4.4.3). All of the molecules are understood to be within one step length, $\Delta x$, of location $x$. During the time increment, $\Delta t$, half of them move $\Delta x$ in either direction by the random walk process; hence, the net flux through an area $A$ at $x$ is given by the difference between the number of molecules, per unit of area, moving from left to right vs. right to left:

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)=\frac{1}{A} \frac{\frac{N_{\mathrm{O}}(x)}{2}-\frac{N_{\mathrm{O}}(x+\Delta x)}{2}}{\Delta t} \tag{4.4.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

Multiplying by $\Delta x^{2} / \Delta x^{2}$ and noting that the concentration is $C_{\mathrm{O}}=N_{\mathrm{O}} / A \Delta x$, we derive

$$
\begin{equation*}
-J_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)=\frac{\Delta x^{2}}{2 \Delta t} \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x+\Delta x)-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x)}{\Delta x} \tag{4.4.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 4.4.4 Fluxes into and out of an element at $x$.

Allowing $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ to approach zero, we obtain (4.4.9). As Einstein noted (19, 25), this derivation confirms the identity of Fick's $D$ as $\Delta x^{2} / 2 \Delta t$.

Fick's second law describes the change in the concentration of O with time: ${ }^{9}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial t}=D_{\mathrm{O}} \frac{\partial^{2} C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial x^{2}} \tag{4.4.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is derived readily from the first law. The change in concentration at a location $x$ is given by the difference in flux into and flux out of an element of width $d x$ (Figure 4.4.4).

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial t}=\frac{J(x, t)-J(x+d x, t)}{d x} \tag{4.4.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

As required, $J / d x$ has units of ( $\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$ )/cm, or concentration per unit time.
The flux at $x+d x$ can be given in terms of that at $x$ by

$$
\begin{equation*}
J(x+d x, t)=J(x, t)+\frac{\partial J(x, t)}{\partial x} d x \tag{4.4.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (4.4.9) we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{\partial J(x, t)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x} D_{\mathrm{O}} \frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial x} \tag{4.4.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

Combination of (4.4.13)-(4.4.15) yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[D_{\mathrm{O}} \frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)}{\partial x}\right] \tag{4.4.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

When $D_{\mathrm{O}}$ is not a function of $x$, (4.4.12) results.
In most electrochemical systems, the changes in solution composition caused by electrolysis are sufficiently small that variations in the diffusion coefficient with $x$ can be neglected. However, when the electroactive component is present at a high concentration, large changes in solution properties, such as the local viscosity, can occur during electrolysis (Section 5.8). For such systems, (4.4.12) is no longer appropriate, and more complicated treatments are necessary (26,27). Under these conditions, migrational effects can also become important.

The general formulation of Fick's second law for any geometry is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}}{\partial t}=D_{\mathrm{O}} \nabla^{2} C_{\mathrm{O}} \tag{4.4.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 4.4.5 Diffusion in solution near different electrodes after an electroreactant has been consumed by reduction or oxidation for a given time. (a) Linear diffusion at a planar electrode. The shaded area is a planar electrode sealed in a cylindrical glass mantle (outer vertical lines). The solution is below the electrode inside the mantle. Each dashed line connects points of equal electroreactant concentration, where the indicated percentage is the fraction of bulk concentration. At the electrode surface, the electroreactant concentration is zero. (b) Radial diffusion at a spherical electrode. The dashed line closest to the electrode (shaded) corresponds to $20 \%$ of the bulk concentration.

where $\nabla^{2}$ is the Laplacian operator. Forms of $\nabla^{2}$ for different geometries are given in Table 4.4.2. Thus, for problems involving a planar electrode (Figure 4.4.5a), the linear diffusion equation, (4.4.12), is appropriate. For problems involving a spherical electrode (Figure 4.4.5b), such as the hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE), the spherical form must be employed:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(r, t)}{\partial t}=D_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\frac{\partial^{2} C_{\mathrm{O}}(r, t)}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{2}{r} \frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{O}}(r, t)}{\partial r}\right) \tag{4.4.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The difference between the linear and spherical equations arises because spherical diffusion takes place through an increasing area at larger $r$.

## 4.4.3 Flux of an Electroreactant at an Electrode Surface

Now consider a linear system where species $k$ is an electroreactant transported purely by diffusion to an electrode, where it undergoes reaction. The corresponding current is proportional to the flux of this species at the electrode surface, $J_{k}(0, t)$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{k}(0, t)=-D_{k}\left[\frac{\partial C_{k}(x, t)}{\partial x}\right]_{x=0} \tag{4.4.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

Because $k$ is consumed at the surface, its concentration profile is positively sloped at $x=0$, and $J_{k}(0, t)$ is always negative. The constant of proportionality between the flux magnitude and the current magnitude is $n F A$, as shown in (1.3.3); however, the current has a sign that depends on whether the reaction is cathodic or anodic. Accordingly,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mp i}{n F A}=J_{k}(0, t)=-D_{k}\left[\frac{\partial C_{k}(x, t)}{\partial x}\right]_{x=0} \quad(- \text { for reduction },+ \text { for oxidation }) \tag{4.4.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{n F A}= \pm D_{k}\left[\frac{\partial C_{k}(x, t)}{\partial x}\right]_{x=0} \quad(+ \text { for reduction, }- \text { for oxidation }) \tag{4.4.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is an important relationship in electrochemistry, because it links the evolving concentration profile near the electrode to the current flowing in an electrochemical experiment. We will draw upon it many times in subsequent chapters.

If several electroactive species are being simultaneously reduced or oxidized, the current is related to the sum of their fluxes at the electrode surface. Thus, for q reducible species,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{F A}=-\sum_{k=1}^{\mathrm{q}} n_{k} J_{k}(0, t)=\sum_{k=1}^{\mathrm{q}} n_{k} D_{k}\left[\frac{\partial C_{k}(x, t)}{\partial x}\right]_{x=0} \tag{4.4.22}
\end{equation*}
$$
