# 4.1 General Mass-Transfer Equations

In Section 1.3, we learned that mass transfer in solution occurs by diffusion, migration, and convection. Both diffusion and migration result from a gradient in electrochemical potential, $\bar{\mu}$ (Section 2.2.4), but convection is caused by a local imbalance of mechanical forces within the solution.


Consider an infinitesimal portion of solution containing two points, $r$ and $s$ (Figure 4.1.1), where, for a certain species $j, \bar{\mu}_{j}(r) \neq \bar{\mu}_{j}(s)$. This difference of $\bar{\mu}_{j}$ over a distance (a gradient of electrochemical potential) can arise because there is a difference in the concentration of species $j$ (a concentration gradient), or because there is a difference of electric potential, $\phi$ (an electric field or electrical potential gradient). In general, movement of species $j$ occurs in the direction of decreasing electrochemical potential, to alleviate any difference of $\bar{\mu}_{j}$. The movement is expressed as a flux, which is the rate of mass transfer per unit of area normal to the direction of transfer; thus, the flux $\mathbf{J}_{j}\left(\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right)$ is a vector quantity proportional to the gradient of electrochemical potential, $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{\mu}_{j}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{J}_{j}=-K_{j} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{\mu}_{j} \tag{4.1.1}
\end{equation*}
$$


where $K_{j}$ is the constant of proportionality and $\boldsymbol{\nabla}$ is the familiar vector operator from mathematics. The minus sign appears in (4.1.1) because the flux vector of species $j$ is in the direction opposite the electrochemical potential gradient, $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{\mu}_{j}$, as the flux acts to reduce the gradient.


The form of $\boldsymbol{\nabla}$ depends on the coordinate system. For linear (one-dimensional) mass transfer, $\boldsymbol{\nabla}=\mathbf{i}(\partial / \partial x)$, where $\mathbf{i}$ is the unit vector along the axis and $x$ is distance. For mass transfer in a three-dimensional Cartesian space,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\nabla=\mathbf{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\mathbf{j} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\mathbf{k} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \tag{4.1.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

If, in addition to this $\bar{\mu}$ gradient, the solution is moving, so that an element of solution with a concentration, $C_{j}$, flows with a velocity vector, $\mathbf{v}$, then an additional term is added to the flux equation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{J}_{j}=-K_{j} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{\mu}_{j}+C_{j} \mathbf{v} \tag{4.1.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathbf{v}$ can have a different direction than $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{\mu}_{j}$.
For linear mass transfer, where all motion occurs in one dimension, (4.1.3) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-K_{j}\left[\frac{\partial \bar{\mu}_{j}(x)}{\partial x}\right]+C_{j} v(x) \tag{4.1.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

From Section 2.2.4, we recognize that $\bar{\mu}_{j}(x)=\mu_{j}^{0}+R T \ln a_{j}(x)+z_{j} F \phi(x)$, where $\mu_{j}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential for species $j, z_{j}$ is its charge, $a_{j}(x)$ is the activity of $j$, and $\phi(x)$ is the electric potential. As indicated, $\bar{\mu}_{j}, a_{j}$, and $\phi$ can be functions of position in the solution. From Section 2.1.5, we have $a_{j}=\gamma_{j} C_{j}(x) / C_{j}^{0}$, where $C_{j}^{0}$ is the standard-state concentration of species $j$, and $\gamma_{j}$ is the activity coefficient. By substitution into (4.1.4), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-K_{j}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[\mu_{j}^{0}+R T \ln \frac{\gamma_{j} C_{j}(x)}{C_{j}^{0}}+z_{j} F \phi(x)\right]\right\}+C_{j}(x) v(x) \tag{4.1.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $C_{j}^{0}$ is a constant and $\gamma_{j}$ usually can be regarded as independent of position, we can take derivatives and rearrange to obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-K_{j}\left[\frac{R T}{C_{j}(x)} \frac{\partial C_{j}(x)}{\partial x}+z_{j} F \frac{\partial \phi(x)}{\partial x}\right]+C_{j}(x) v(x) \tag{4.1.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

The two terms in brackets represent contributions to the flux from diffusion and migration, respectively. The diffusional contribution is given by Fick's first law, which we will show in Section 4.4.2 to have the following form for the one-dimensional case:

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}=-D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}(x)}{\partial x} \tag{4.1.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $D_{j}$ is the diffusion coefficient of species $j$. By comparing the first term of (4.1.6) with (4.1.7), we see that

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{j}=D_{j} C_{j}(x) / R T \tag{4.1.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution into (4.1.6) yields the final result,

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}(x)}{\partial x}-\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j}(x) \frac{\partial \phi(x)}{\partial x}+C_{j}(x) v(x) \tag{4.1.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is a modified Nernst-Planck equation. ${ }^{1}$ The general form of this transport equation is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{J}_{j}=-D_{j} \boldsymbol{\nabla} C_{j}-\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j} \boldsymbol{\nabla} \phi+C_{j} \mathbf{v} \tag{4.1.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

If species $j$ is an ion, its diffusion coefficient, $D_{j}$, and its ionic mobility, $u_{j}$, (Section 2.3.3) are linked by the Nernst-Einstein equation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{j}=\frac{u_{j} k T}{\left|z_{j}\right| e}=\frac{u_{j} R T}{\left|z_{j}\right| F} \tag{4.1.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, one can express the modified Nernst-Planck equation in terms of mobility:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{J}_{j}=-D_{j} \nabla C_{j}-\frac{u_{j} z_{j} C_{j}}{\left|z_{j}\right|} \nabla \phi+C_{j} \mathbf{v} \tag{4.1.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

In any of the three forms of the modified Nernst-Planck equation given above, the first, second, and third terms express the contributions to the flux due to diffusion, migration, and convection, respectively. To describe local concentrations and local fluxes in a system where mass transfer is occurring, one must solve this transport equation under specified mathematical conditions (initial and boundary conditions) that define the system at hand (Section 4.5). If all three modes of mass transfer are important, then all three terms must be retained in the modified Nernst-Planck equation. If one or two modes are known not to be important, the corresponding terms can be dropped, and a simplified transport equation can be used to describe the system.

In this chapter, we focus on systems without convection, which is a topic deferred until Chapter 10. Under quiescent conditions (i.e., in an unstirred or stagnant solution), the solution velocity, $\mathbf{v}$, is zero, so the Nernst-Planck equation applies,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{J}_{j}=-D_{j} \nabla C_{j}-\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j} \nabla \phi \tag{4.1.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

For linear mass transfer, this is

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}(x)}{\partial x}-\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j}(x) \frac{\partial \phi(x)}{\partial x} \tag{4.1.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

If species $j$ is charged, its flux is equivalent to a local current density. To show this, let us consider a linear system having a cross-sectional area, $A$, normal to the axis of mass flow, which occurs along dimension $x$. We define a positive current as the movement of positive charge toward lesser $x$ (toward the left) or the movement of negative charge to the right. A positive flux of any species corresponds to movement toward greater $x$, i.e., toward the right. Then, $J_{j}\left(\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right)$ is equal to $-i_{j} / z_{j} F A\left[\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{s}\right.$ per $\left.\left(\mathrm{C} \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)\right],{ }^{2}$ where $i_{j}$ is the current component at any value of $x$ arising from the flux of species $j$. Equation 4.1.14 can then be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
-J_{j}=\frac{i_{j}}{z_{j} F A}=\frac{i_{\mathrm{d}, j}}{z_{j} F A}+\frac{i_{\mathrm{m}, j}}{z_{j} F A} \tag{4.1.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^0]with
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{i_{\mathrm{d}, j}}{z_{j} F A} & =D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}}{\partial x}  \tag{4.1.16}\\
\frac{i_{\mathrm{m}, j}}{z_{j} F A} & =\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \tag{4.1.17}
\end{align*}
$$
where $i_{\mathrm{d}, j}$ and $i_{\mathrm{m}, j}$ are diffusion and migration currents of species $j$, respectively.
At any location in solution during electrolysis, the total current, $i$, is made up of contributions from all species; that is,
$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\sum_{j} i_{j} \tag{4.1.18}
\end{equation*}
$$
or, from (4.1.16)-(4.1.18),
$$
\begin{equation*}
i=F A \sum_{j} z_{j} D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}}{\partial x}+\frac{F^{2} A}{R T} \cdot \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \sum_{j} z_{j}^{2} D_{j} C_{j} \tag{4.1.19}
\end{equation*}
$$
where the current at that location for each species is made up of a diffusional component (from the corresponding term in the first summation) and a migrational component (from the corresponding term in the second summation). ${ }^{3}$

We now proceed to discuss migration and diffusion in electrochemical systems in more detail. The concepts and equations derived below date back to at least the work of Fick (1) and Planck (2). Further details concerning the general problem of mass transfer in electrochemical systems can be found in a number of reviews (3-8).
