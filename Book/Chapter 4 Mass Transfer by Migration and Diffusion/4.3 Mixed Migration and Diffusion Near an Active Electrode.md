# 4.3 Mixed Migration and Diffusion Near an Active Electrode

The relative contributions of diffusion and migration to the flux of a species (and of the flux of that species to the total current) differ at a given time for different locations in solution (9-11). Near the electrode, the concentrations of electroreactants and electroproducts deviate from those of the bulk because of the local effects of the electrode reactions. There are concentration profiles smoothly connecting the surface concentrations with the bulk values. These profiles extend over distances that are usually small $(1-100 \mu \mathrm{~m})$ compared to the dimensions of the cell. Most of the solution is in the bulk, where mass transfer is by migration (Section 4.2). But near the electrodes, where concentrations vary with spatial location, an electroactive substance is, in general, transported by both migration and diffusion.

The flux of an electroactive substance at the electrode surface is proportional to the rate of its reaction and, therefore, to the corresponding faradaic current flowing in the external circuit (Sections 1.3.1 and 4.4.3). That current can be conceptually separated into diffusion and migration currents reflecting the diffusive and migrational components to the flux of the electroactive species at the surface:

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{\mathrm{d}}+i_{\mathrm{m}} \tag{4.3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 4.3.1 Examples of reduction processes with different contributions of the migration current: (a) positively charged reactant, (b) negatively charged reactant, (c) uncharged reactant. The effects illustrated here can be readily observed in steady-state voltammetry at a UME (Section 5.7).

The fluxes associated with $i_{\mathrm{d}}$ and $i_{\mathrm{m}}$ may be in the same or opposite directions, depending on the direction of the electric field and the charge on the electroactive species. Examples of three reductions-of a positively charged, a negatively charged, and an uncharged substance-are shown in Figure 4.3.1. The migrational component is in the same direction as $i_{\mathrm{d}}$ for reduction of a cationic species and for oxidation of an anionic species. It opposes $i_{\mathrm{d}}$ when anions are being reduced and when cations are being oxidized.

## 4.3.1 Balance Sheets for Mass Transfer During Electrolysis

To illustrate the mass-transfer effects in a whole cell, let us apply a "balance sheet" approach $(9,12)$ to several examples.

### (a) Electrolysis of HCl

Consider the cell in Figure 4.3.2a, and assume that a total current of $10 e$ per unit time is passed through the cell, producing five $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules at the cathode and five $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ molecules at the anode. ${ }^{4}$ From Table 2.3.2, we see that the equivalent ionic conductivity for $\mathrm{H}^{+}\left(\lambda_{+}\right)$is about four times larger than that for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\left(\lambda_{-}\right)$, i.e., $\lambda_{+} \approx 4 \lambda_{-}$; therefore, we find from (4.2.9) that $t_{+}=0.8$ and $t_{-}=0.2$. The total current is carried in the bulk solution by the movement, per unit time, of $8 \mathrm{H}^{+}$toward the cathode and $2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$toward the anode (Figure $4.3 .2 b$ ). To maintain a steady current, $10 \mathrm{H}^{+}$must be supplied to the cathode per unit time, so an additional $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$must diffuse to the electrode, bringing along $2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to maintain electroneutrality. Similarly, to supply $10 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ per unit time at the anode, $8 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$must arrive by diffusion, along with $8 \mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, the different currents (in arbitrary $e$-units per unit time) are: for $\mathrm{H}^{+}, i_{\mathrm{d}}=2, i_{\mathrm{m}}=8$; for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, i_{\mathrm{d}}=8, i_{\mathrm{m}}=2$. The total current, $i$, is 10. Equation 4.3.1 holds, with migration in this case being in the same direction as diffusion.

If a single species is undergoing electrolysis at one of the electrodes, the total number of moles electrolyzed per second is $|i / n F|$. Of this amount, the number of moles being supplied or withheld per second by migration is $\left|i_{\mathrm{m}} / n F\right|$, which we can define more fully by considering the behavior in the bulk. For mixtures of charged species, the fraction of current carried in the bulk by the $j$ th species is $t_{j}$, and the current carried by that species is $t_{j} i$. The number of moles of the $j$ th species migrating per second is then $\left|t_{j} i / z_{j} F\right|$. For the species being electrolyzed,

Figure 4.3.2 Balance sheet for electrolysis of HCl solution. (a) Cell schematic. (b) Various contributions to the current when 10e are passed in the external circuit per unit time.

this quantity is also $\left|i_{\mathrm{m}} / n F\right|$, because we assume the migration current for any species to apply everywhere in the solution (in the bulk or near the electrode surface). Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{i_{\mathrm{m}}}{n F}\right|=\left|\frac{t_{j} i}{z_{j} F}\right| \tag{4.3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we take account of current direction and the sign of $z_{j}$, this becomes ${ }^{5}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{\mathrm{m}}= \pm \frac{n}{z_{j}} t_{j} i \quad(+ \text { for reduction },- \text { for oxidation }) \tag{4.3.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

From equation 4.3.1,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{\mathrm{d}}=i\left(1 \mp \frac{n t_{j}}{z_{j}}\right) \quad(+ \text { for reduction },- \text { for oxidation }) \tag{4.3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

The assumption that $i_{\mathrm{m}}$ is uniform everywhere in solution is equivalent to assuming that the transference numbers are the same everywhere. This will be true when the concentrations of ions in the solution are high, and only small fractional changes in local concentration are caused by the electrolytic generation or removal of ions. If the electrolysis significantly perturbs the ionic concentrations in the diffusion layer compared to those in the bulk solution, the $t_{j}$ values must vary near the electrode, as required by (4.2.9). In such cases, the treatment developed here provides only approximations of the component currents assignable to diffusion and migration. ${ }^{6}$

(b) Various contributions to the current when $6 e$ are passed in the external circuit per unit time; $i=6, n=1$. For $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ at the cathode, $\left|i_{m}\right|=(1 / 2)(1 / 3)(6)=1$ (equation 4.3.3), $i_{d}=6-1=5$ (equation 4.3.4). For $\mathrm{Cu}(1)$ at the anode, $\left|i_{m}\right|=(1 / 1)(1 / 6)(6)=1, i_{d}=6+1=7$.

### (b) Electrolysis of Copper Complexes Without Added Electrolyte

Now consider a cell containing $10^{-3} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cu}^{-}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}^{2+}, 10^{-3} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cu}^{-}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}^{+}$, and $3 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (Figure 4.3.3a). If the equivalent conductances of all ions are equal, i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})}=\lambda_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})}=\lambda_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}=\lambda \tag{4.3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

the transference numbers in the bulk are obtained from (4.2.9) as $t_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})}=1 / 3, t_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})}=1 / 6$ and $t_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}=1 / 2$. With a current of $6 e$ per unit time being passed through the cell, the current in bulk solution is carried by migration of one Cu (II) and one Cu (I) toward the cathode, and three $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ toward the anode.

The balance sheet for this system is shown in Figure 4.3.3b. At the cathode, one-sixth of the current for the reduction of $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ is provided by migration and five-sixths by diffusion. ${ }^{7}$ The $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, being uncharged, does not contribute to the carrying of the current, but serves only to stabilize the copper species in the +1 and +2 states. The resistance of this cell would be relatively large, since the total concentration of ions in the solution is small.

(b) Various contributions to the current when $6 e$ are passed in the external circuit per unit time $(i=6, n=1) . t_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})}=\left[\left(2 \times 10^{-3}\right) \lambda /\left(2 \times 10^{-3}+10^{-3}+3 \times 10^{-3}+0.2\right) \lambda\right]=0.0097$. For $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ at the cathode, $\left|i_{\mathrm{m}}\right|=(1 / 2)(0.0097)(6)=0.03, i_{\mathrm{d}}=6-0.03=5.97$.

### (c) Electrolysis of Copper Complexes with Excess Electrolyte

Finally, let us consider the same cell as in the preceding example, but with the addition of $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaClO}_{4}$ (Figure 4.3.4a). Assuming that the equivalent ionic conductivities of all ionic species are equal to $\lambda$, the transference numbers in the bulk become $t_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}=t_{\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}}=0.485$, $t_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})}=0.0097, t_{\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})}=0.00485, t_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}=0.0146$. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$do not participate in the electron-transfer reactions; but they carry $97 \%$ of the current in the bulk solution, because their concentrations are high. The balance sheet for this cell (Figure 4.3.4b) shows that most of the Cu (II) now reaches the cathode by diffusion, with only $0.5 \%$ of the total flux by migration.

## 4.3.2 Utility of a Supporting Electrolyte

The preceding example shows that an added excess of electroinactive ions (a supporting electrolyte) nearly eliminates the contribution of migration to the mass transfer of an electroactive species. This is a valuable, general result. The presence of a supporting electrolyte simplifies the mathematical treatment of an electrochemical system by rendering the migrational terms negligible in the mass transport equations for electroreactants and electroproducts near the electrode. Consequently, it has become standard electrochemical practice to add an excess supporting electrolyte, unless there are specific overriding considerations, such as mentioned below.

A supporting electrolyte must be selected for compatibility with both the solvent and the electrode process of interest. Many acids, bases, and salts are available for aqueous solutions. For organic solvents with high dielectric constants, such as acetonitrile and $N, N$-dimethylformamide, normal practice is to employ tetra- $n$-alkylammonium salts, such as $\mathrm{Bu}_{4} \mathrm{NBF}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{Et}_{4} \mathrm{NClO}_{4}$ ( $\mathrm{Bu}=n$-butyl, $\mathrm{Et}=$ ethyl). Studies in low-dielectric solvents, such as benzene, inevitably involve solutions of high resistance, because most ionic salts do not appreciably dissolve in such solvents. Salts that do dissolve in apolar media, such as $\mathrm{Hx}_{4} \mathrm{NClO}_{4}$ (where $\mathrm{Hx}=n$-hexyl), undergo extensive ion pairing, which reduces conductivity.

In addition to minimizing the contribution of migration, the supporting electrolyte serves other important functions:

- It decreases the uncompensated ohmic potential drop between the working and reference electrodes (Section 1.5.4); consequently, the supporting electrolyte improves the accuracy with which the working electrode potential is controlled or measured [Sections 1.6.4(d) and 16.7].
- Improved conductivity in the bulk of the solution reduces the electrical power dissipated in the cell and can lead to simplifications in apparatus (Sections 12.1.3 and 16.7).
- Frequently, the supporting electrolyte establishes important reaction conditions, such as pH , ionic strength, or ligand concentration.
- In analytical applications, the supporting electrolyte (often also serving as a buffer) can reduce or eliminate sample matrix effects.
- A supporting electrolyte ensures that the electrical double layer remains thin with respect to the diffusion layer (Section 14.3), and it establishes a uniform ionic strength throughout the solution, even when ions are produced or consumed at the electrodes.

Supporting electrolytes also bring some disadvantages. Because they are used in large concentrations, their impurities can present serious interferences, for example, by giving rise to faradaic responses of their own, by reacting with the intended product of an electrode process, or by adsorbing on the electrode surface and altering kinetics. Also, a supporting electrolyte significantly alters the medium in the cell, so that its properties differ from those of the pure solvent. The difference can complicate the comparison of results obtained from electrochemical experiments (e.g., thermodynamic data) with data from other kinds of experiments, in which pure solvents are typically employed.

Sometimes, one seeks, for good reasons, to examine systems with low concentrations of supporting electrolyte-even systems without any added electrolyte beyond the electroactive species to be studied. UMEs have made such work practical. In this arena, migration is always a major consideration and must be brought explicitly into the theory. Further discussion of such systems is deferred to Section 5.7.
