In Chapters 1 and 3, we came to understand that electrode reactions proceed at rates determined not only by reaction kinetics, but also by mass-transfer processes controlling the delivery of reactants to an electrode surface. In this chapter, we focus on the fundamentals of mass transfer, including important partial differential equations, which we will employ frequently in later chapters to develop theory for a large range of electrochemical techniques.

    2 The minus sign is needed because of the direction chosen for positive current. A positive current resulting from movement of a species with $z_{j}=+1$ corresponds to a negative flux of that species (movement toward the left). If the moving species has $\boldsymbol{z}_{\boldsymbol{j}}=-1$, a positive current corresponds to a positive

[^1]:    3 The component currents assigned to diffusion and migration of a species are conceptual. They are useful for thinking about contributions to the overall current at a point in space, but they are not separately measurable or independently controllable.

[^2]:    4 Actually, some $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ could also be formed at the anode; for simplicity we neglect this reaction.

[^3]:    5 As discussed in connection with Figure 4.3.1, $i_{\mathrm{m}}$ is in the same direction as $i$ when cations are reduced or anions are oxidized, but $i_{\mathrm{m}}$ opposes $i$ when anions are reduced or cations are oxidized.
    6 Section 5.7 covers experiments using ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) in low ionic strength solutions, in which faradaic reactions significantly change the concentrations of both the redox species and inert electrolyte ions near the electrode surface, resulting in position-dependent transference numbers.

[^4]:    7 A rigorous computation of the faradaic current in such a system would involve using the Nernst-Planck equation to obtain the fluxes of Cu (II) and other ionic species.

[^5]:    8 The diffusion coefficient was introduced phenomenologically in 1855 by Fick (1), as he proposed the relationship now known as Fick's first law (Section 4.4.2). In 1905, Einstein $(18,19)$ derived (4.4.2) and showed $l^{2} 2 \tau$ to be the same as Fick's $D$. Soon thereafter, Langevin (20) derived (4.4.2) by a completely different approach starting with Newton's second law. Sometimes, $D$ is given as $f l^{2} / 2$, where $f$ is the number of displacements per unit time $(=1 / \tau)$.

[^6]:    9 Fick's second law is often called a continuity or mass-conservation equation.

[^7]:    10 It is not necessary at this stage to understand how reaction terms are included in these equations. Chapter 13 will provide numerous examples.
    11 It is often easy to do this. Section 6.1 fully covers the conditions, which are widely implemented.
    12 There are two different derivatives on time in (4.5.1 $a$ and 4.5.1b), plus four different derivatives on concentration, including the second derivatives.
