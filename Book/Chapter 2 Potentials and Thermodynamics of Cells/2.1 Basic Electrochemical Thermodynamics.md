## 2.1.1 Reversibility

Thermodynamics strictly applies only to systems at equilibrium, which involves the idea that a process can move readily in opposite directions from the equilibrium position. The adjective reversible relates to this core idea; however, the word carries several different, but related, meanings. We distinguish three of them now.

Consider the electrochemical cell shown in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 1.1.1b</span>:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.1.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Experimentally, one finds that the difference in potential between the silver wire and the platinum wire is 0.222 V when all substances are in their standard states. ${ }^{1}$ The platinum wire is the negative electrode. When the two electrodes are shorted together, electrons flow from the Pt electrode through the external circuit to the Ag electrode, and the following reaction takes place:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{AgCl} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \tag{2.1.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

If one overcomes the cell voltage by opposing it with the output of a battery or other direct current (dc) source, the current flow through the cell reverses, and the new cell reaction is

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{AgCl} \tag{2.1.3}
\end{equation*}
$$



> [!Lessons] Chemical Reversibility
> **Lesson 1:** The sign of a measured cell voltage matters. Always identify which electrode is negative (the anode during discharge) and use that to set the direction of electron flow in the external circuit (electrons flow anode $\rightarrow$ cathode; conventional current flows opposite).
> 
> **Lesson 2:** A chemically reversible cell is one in which reversing the direction of current reverses the direction of the *same* overall redox reaction: the net reaction under forced current reversal is the exact reverse of the net reaction during discharge, with no new electrode reactions appearing.

This same workflow will be used throughout the chapter when connecting measured potentials to reaction direction and thermodynamic driving force.

In contrast, the system

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-} / \mathrm{Pt} \tag{2.1.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

is not chemically reversible. The zinc electrode is negative with respect to platinum, and discharging the cell causes dissolution of the zinc:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e \tag{2.1.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

At the platinum electrode, hydrogen evolves:

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{2.1.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the net cell reaction is ${ }^{2}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} \tag{2.1.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

By applying an opposing voltage larger than the cell voltage, one can reverse the current, but the reactions observed are

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} & \text { (Zn electrode) } \\
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 e & \text { (Pt electrode) } \\
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} & \text { (Net) } \tag{2.1.10}
\end{array}
$$

Upon current reversal, one has different electrode reactions, as well as a different net process; hence, this cell is said to be chemically irreversible.


> [!Lessons] Chemical Irreversibility
> **Lesson 1:** Chemical reversibility is diagnosed operationally by current reversal: if reversing the current produces the reverse of the original net reaction (with the same electrode reactions, just reversed), the system is chemically reversible; if new reactions appear, it is chemically irreversible.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Reversing current in an electrochemical cell does not guarantee that the reverse of the discharge chemistry will occur. When the “reverse” reaction is not accessible under the new driving conditions, competing reactions (often involving solvent or electrolyte) can dominate the electrode processes.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Treat “cell discharge” and “forced electrolysis” as distinct regimes: always re-identify what reactions occur at each electrode under the imposed current direction before writing the net process.

One can similarly characterize half-reactions by their chemical reversibility. Under the stated conditions (oxygen-free, dry acetonitrile), the initial one-electron reduction product is a sufficiently stable radical anion that it is not rapidly consumed by follow-up chemistry. As a result, if the driving force is reversed, back electron transfer can occur and regenerate nitrobenzene. Therefore, the nitrobenzene couple behaves as a chemically reversible, one-electron process:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{PhNO}_{2}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{PhNO}_{2} \bar{\bullet} \tag{2.1.11}
\end{equation*}
$$



> [!Lessons] Half-Reaction Reversibility
> **Lesson 1:** A half-reaction is chemically reversible only if electron transfer can proceed cleanly in *both* directions on the experimental time scale, with no competing chemistry consuming the oxidized or reduced form.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Stability of the initial electron-transfer product is the practical diagnostic: if the radical ion survives long enough for back electron transfer to occur, the couple can appear reversible; if it is rapidly consumed, it will appear irreversible.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** “Reversible vs irreversible” is not a property of the redox couple alone. Solvent, supporting electrolyte, impurities (especially $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$), and other solution conditions can determine whether a one-electron couple behaves reversibly.

> \mathrm{ArX}+e \rightarrow \mathrm{Ar} \bar{\bullet}+\mathrm{X}^{-} \tag{2.1.12}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> Classify this half-reaction as chemically reversible or chemically irreversible, and state what feature of the chemistry controls the classification.


The reduction of an aromatic halide, ArX, under similar conditions is normally chemically irreversible because the initial electron-transfer product, $\mathrm{ArX}\bar{\bullet}$, is not stable on the experimental time scale. Instead of persisting long enough to undergo back electron transfer (which would regenerate $\mathrm{ArX}$ when the driving force is reversed), it rapidly fragments by C–X bond cleavage to give a different chemical species, $\mathrm{Ar}\bar{\bullet}$, plus $\mathrm{X}^{-}$. Once this follow-up chemistry has occurred, reversing the current cannot simply undo the original reduction step; accordingly, the process is chemically irreversible:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{ArX}+e \rightarrow \mathrm{Ar} \bar{\bullet}+\mathrm{X}^{-} \tag{2.1.12}
\end{equation*}
$$


> [!Lessons] Coupled Chemical Steps
> **Lesson 1:** Chemical irreversibility often arises because electron transfer is followed by a fast chemical step (cleavage, protonation, dimerization, etc.) that removes the initial redox product, preventing the reverse electron-transfer step.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** To decide whether a half-reaction is chemically reversible, ask whether reversing the current would regenerate the original species or whether the system has already moved on to different chemical products.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Apparent reversibility depends on conditions and time scale: a reaction can look reversible if follow-up chemistry is slow relative to the measurement, but irreversible if follow-up chemistry is fast.



Whether a half-reaction exhibits chemical reversibility depends upon solution conditions and the time scale of the experiment.


> [!exercise] Exercise 5: Conditions and Time Scale
> Chemical reversibility of a one-electron couple can change with solution conditions and with the experimental time scale.
> 
> **Part A:** Nitrobenzene is reduced in acidic acetonitrile, where the radical anion $\mathrm{PhNO}_{2} \bar{\bullet}$ can react with protons. Predict whether the nitrobenzene reduction would appear chemically reversible or chemically irreversible under these conditions.
> 
> **Part B:** An aromatic halide $\mathrm{ArX}$ is reduced to a radical anion $\mathrm{ArX} \bar{\bullet}$ that can decay on a finite time scale. Explain how studying this couple with a sufficiently fast technique could make the electron-transfer step appear chemically reversible, and write the corresponding one-electron reaction.


**Part A:** In acidic acetonitrile, the radical anion $\mathrm{PhNO}_{2} \bar{\bullet}$ is rapidly removed by protonation (a follow-up chemical step). Because this chemical reaction consumes the electron-transfer product, reversing the driving force cannot simply regenerate $\mathrm{PhNO}_{2}$ by back electron transfer on the experimental time scale; the overall electrode process therefore appears chemically irreversible under these conditions. 

**Part B:** In contrast, suppose $\mathrm{ArX}\bar{\bullet}$ does decay, but only after a finite lifetime. If the experiment probes the system on a time scale short compared with that decay, the electrode can effectively “see” only the initial electron-transfer equilibrium, and the step

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{ArX}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{ArX} \bar{\bullet} \tag{2.1.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

can appear chemically reversible, because the decay of the radical anion takes longer than the observational time scale.


> [!Lessons] Context-Dependent Reversibility
> **Lesson 1:** Chemical reversibility is conditional: changing the solution composition (e.g., adding acid) can introduce fast follow-up reactions that convert an otherwise reversible electron-transfer step into an irreversible process.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** “Reversible” can be an experimental statement. A process may appear reversible if the measurement time is short compared with the time scale of chemical decay, even if the same species would decompose on longer time scales.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** When classifying reversibility, always compare competing time scales: electron transfer, chemical follow-up reactions, and the time window of the measurement.


### (b) Thermodynamic Reversibility

A process is ==thermodynamically reversible== if an infinitesimal reversal in a driving force causes it to reverse direction. This can be true only if the system feels an infinitesimal driving force at any time; hence, it must be always at equilibrium. A ==reversible path== between two states of the system is, therefore, one that connects a continuum of equilibrium states. Traversing it would require an infinite length of time.

**Chemical reversibility is a necessary condition for thermodynamic reversibility in an electrochemical cell:** if reversing the current leads to different electrode reactions (and a different net process), then the original transformation cannot be reversed by an infinitesimal change in driving force. However, **chemical reversibility is not sufficient.** Even a chemically reversible cell will behave thermodynamically irreversibly when it is driven at a finite rate, because finite currents require finite departures from equilibrium (overpotentials and concentration gradients). Only in the limit of operation arbitrarily close to equilibrium (e.g., vanishing current) can the cell approach thermodynamic reversibility.


### (c) Practical Reversibility

Since all real processes occur at finite rates, none can proceed with strict thermodynamic reversibility. However, a process may be carried out in such a manner that thermodynamic equations apply to a desired accuracy. For practical purposes, one may then describe the process as "reversible." ==Practical reversibility== is therefore an accuracy-based designation: it means that the process is conducted close enough to equilibrium (small driving forces and small dissipative losses) that treating it as reversible introduces errors smaller than the tolerance required for the problem at hand.



> [!exercise] Exercise 6: Practical vs Thermodynamic Reversibility
> A spring balance with force constant $k$ supports a mass $m$, stretching the spring by a distance $x$ under gravity $g$.
> 
> **Part A:** Describe how to remove the mass in a thermodynamically reversible way, and state the relation between $x$ and $m$ that holds throughout such a reversible process.
> 
> **Part B:** If the same final state is reached by removing the mass all at once, explain whether the equilibrium relation applies during the process and why.
> 
> **Part C:** If the mass is removed in many small pieces, explain what it would mean to call the process “practically reversible” in this context.


**Part A:** A useful analogy involves removing a large weight from a spring balance. Carrying out this process thermodynamically reversibly requires continuous (or arbitrarily close) mechanical equilibrium, so that an infinitesimal change in the applied load would reverse the direction of motion. Under these conditions the equilibrium relation holds throughout the process:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k x=m g \tag{2.1.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Here $k$ is the force constant, $x$ is the extension of the spring under the instantaneous load, and $g$ is the earth's gravitational acceleration. To keep the system near equilibrium at all times, the weight must be reduced progressively in infinitesimal portions, so the spring contracts only by an infinitesimal amount at each step.

**Part B:** If the same final state is reached by removing the weight all at once, the spring-balance system is driven far from equilibrium during the motion. Equation (2.1.14) still relates the equilibrium initial and final states, but it does not describe the intermediate states along the actual trajectory; the process is grossly irreversible.

**Part C:** Alternatively, one could remove the weight in many small pieces, allowing the system to re-equilibrate between removals. If the pieces are small enough that departures from equilibrium are slight and brief, then (2.1.14) will hold for most of the process to a good approximation. In that regime, the real (still slightly irreversible) transformation can be treated as reversible for practical calculations, which is the sense in which it is “practically reversible.”



> [!Lessons] Practical Reversibility
> **Lesson 1:** Thermodynamic reversibility requires the system to pass through a continuum of equilibrium states, which in practice means an infinitesimal driving force and (ideally) an infinitely slow process.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Equilibrium relations (like $k x=m g$) apply *along a reversible path*; if a process is driven far from equilibrium, those relations may still describe the initial and final states but need not hold during the transformation.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Practical reversibility is an accuracy statement: a real, finite-step process can be treated as reversible if deviations from equilibrium are small enough that the thermodynamic (equilibrium) equations describe the process to the desired tolerance.


#### (c.1) Electrochemical (Nernstian) Reversibility

In electrochemistry, one frequently relies on the Nernst equation to provide a linkage between electrode potential, $E$, and the concentrations of participants in the electrode process:


> [!equation] Nernst equation (concentration form; formal potential)
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}} \tag{2.1.15}
> \end{equation*}
> 
> $$
> 
> 



> [!Equation] Generic electrode half-reaction
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> \mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R} \tag{2.1.16}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 


If an electrode process obeys the Nernst relation (often written in terms of activities, and in many applications approximated using concentrations as in (2.1.15)), then the electrode reaction is often said to be ==thermodynamically reversible electrode process== or ==electrochemically reversible== (i.e., ==nernstian==).



#### (c.2) Apparent Reversibility and Experimental Time Scale

Whether a process appears reversible depends on how closely it remains to equilibrium on the time scale of the measurement. That, in turn, is controlled by (i) the time window and sensitivity of the measurement, (ii) how rapidly the driving force is changed, and (iii) how quickly the system relaxes back toward equilibrium. If the perturbation is sufficiently small, or if relaxation is sufficiently fast compared with the observation time, then equilibrium thermodynamic relations can describe the process to good accuracy. The same physical system may therefore appear reversible in one experiment and irreversible in another if the conditions or time scale differ.




## 2.1.2 Reversibility and Gibbs Free Energy

> Consider the reaction $\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{AgCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and constant atmospheric pressure. Assume the extent of reaction is small enough that activities remain at their standard-state values throughout each experiment.

> 
> **Part B:** The cell in Figure 1.1.1a with schematic (2.1.17) is discharged through a load resistance $R$. The *total* heat evolved (cell + resistor) is $233~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ of Zn reacted, independent of $R$. State what this implies about $\Delta H^{0}$ for the cell reaction.
> 
> **Part C:** With the cell and resistor in separate calorimeters, $Q_{\mathrm{C}}+Q_{\mathrm{R}}=-233~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ of Zn reacted (independent of $R$), but in the limit $R\rightarrow\infty$ one observes $Q_{\mathrm{C}}\rightarrow -43~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and $Q_{\mathrm{R}}\rightarrow -190~\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. Use these limiting values to determine $T\Delta S^{0}$ and $\Delta G^{0}$, and interpret the physical meaning of $-\Delta G^{0}$ in this context.
> 


**Note:** This exercise compares three experimental realizations of the same overall reaction in order to separate (i) the total enthalpy change of reaction from (ii) the portion of that energy change that can appear as electrical (non-PV) work in the external circuit. Parts A–C correspond to (1) direct calorimetry, (2) calorimetry of the entire cell + load, and (3) separate calorimetry of the cell and the load.

Consider three different methods (1) of carrying out the reaction
$\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{AgCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}:$

1) Suppose zinc and silver chloride are mixed directly in a calorimeter at constant atmospheric pressure and at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assume also that the extent of reaction is so small that the activities of all species remain unchanged during the experiment. The amount of heat liberated when all substances are in their standard states is found to be $233 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of Zn reacted. Thus, the standard enthalpy of reaction, $\Delta H^{0}$, is $-233 \mathrm{~kJ} .^{3}$

2) Suppose we now construct the cell of Figure 1.1.1a, that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(a=1), \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a=1) / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.1.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

and discharge it through a resistance $R$. Again, we assume that the extent of reaction is small enough to keep the activities essentially unchanged. During the discharge, heat evolves from both the resistor and the cell, and we can measure the total heat change by placing the entire apparatus inside a calorimeter. The heat evolved is $233 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of Zn, independent of $R$. That is, $\Delta H^{0}=-233 \mathrm{~kJ}$, regardless of the rate of cell discharge.

3) Let us now repeat the experiment with the cell and the resistor in separate calorimeters. Assume that the wires connecting them have no resistance and do not conduct any heat between the calorimeters. Let $Q_{\mathrm{C}}$ be the heat change in the cell calorimeter and $Q_{\mathrm{R}}$ that in the resistor calorimeter (negative for heat evolved). One finds that $Q_{\mathrm{C}}+Q_{\mathrm{R}}=-233 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of Zn reacted, independent of $R$, but the partition between these terms depends on the discharge rate. As $R$ increases, $\left|Q_{\mathrm{C}}\right|$ decreases and $\left|Q_{\mathrm{R}}\right|$ increases. In the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$, $Q_{\mathrm{C}}$ approaches -43 kJ per mole of zinc and $Q_{\mathrm{R}}$ tends toward -190 kJ .

The energy associated with $Q_{\mathrm{R}}$ is delivered to the external circuit as electrical energy (and is dissipated as heat in the resistor only because the load is resistive), so it represents energy that could, in principle, be converted to other forms of non-PV work. In contrast, $Q_{\mathrm{C}}$ is the thermal energy that appears in the cell itself. Discharge through $R \rightarrow \infty$ corresponds to operation arbitrarily close to equilibrium and therefore to a thermodynamically reversible discharge. Hence, in this limit we may identify $\lim _{R \rightarrow \infty} Q_{\mathrm{C}}$ with $Q_{\text {rev }}$, the heat that must appear along a reversible path. By definition, $\Delta S=Q_{\text {rev }}/T(2)$; thus, for our example in standard states,

$$
\begin{equation*}
T \Delta S^{0}=\lim _{R \rightarrow \infty} Q_{\mathrm{C}}=-43 \mathrm{~kJ} \tag{2.1.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Because $\Delta G^{0}=\Delta H^{0}-T \Delta S^{0}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G^{0}=-190 \mathrm{~kJ}=\lim _{R \rightarrow \infty} Q_{\mathrm{R}} \tag{2.1.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

We have now identified $-\Delta G$ with the maximum net work obtainable from the cell, where net work is defined as work other than PV work (2). In particular, in the reversible limit $R \rightarrow \infty$, the energy delivered to the external circuit approaches $-\Delta G^{0}$, while for any finite $R$ dissipation within the cell reduces the obtainable non-PV work below this limiting value.



> [!Lessons] Free Energy from Reversible Work
> **Lesson 1:** $\Delta H$ is a state function: the standard enthalpy change $\Delta H^{0}$ is the same regardless of whether a reaction is carried out directly in a calorimeter or indirectly through an electrochemical cell and an external load.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** For a reversible path, the heat that *must* appear as heat is $Q_{\mathrm{rev}}=T\Delta S$. In an electrochemical context, the limit $R\rightarrow\infty$ corresponds to reversible discharge, so measured heat in the cell can be used to extract $\Delta S^{0}$.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** The maximum non-PV work obtainable from a process at constant $T$ and $P$ is $-\Delta G$. In a cell, the portion of the energy change that can appear as electrical energy (and thus be converted to other forms of work) approaches this limit only under reversible operation.





## 2.1.3 Free Energy and Cell emf

Just above, we recognized that if the electrochemical cell (2.1.17) were discharged through an infinite load resistance, the discharge would be reversible. The potential difference would always be the equilibrium (open-circuit) value. Since the extent of reaction is assumed to be small enough that all activities remain constant, the potential also remains constant. Then, the energy dissipated in $R$ is given by


> [!equation] Free energy magnitude from reversible cell potential
> 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> & |\Delta G|=\text { charge passed × reversible potential difference }  \tag{2.1.20}\\
> & |\Delta G|=n F|E| \tag{2.1.21}
> \end{align*}
> $$
> 
> 

where $n$ is the number of electrons passed per atom of zinc reacted (or the number of moles of electrons per mole of Zn reacted), and $F$ is the charge on a mole of electrons $(96,485 \mathrm{C})$.

We also recognize that the free energy change has a sign associated with the direction of the net cell reaction. The sign reverses with a change of direction. Yet, only an infinitesimal change in the potential difference is required for the reversal; consequently, $E$ is essentially constant and independent of the direction of a (reversible) transformation. We have a quandary: We want to relate a direction-sensitive quantity ( $\Delta G$ ) to a direction-insensitive observable ( $E$ ). This desire is the origin of the confusion that commonly exists over signs in electrochemical systems. [Paragraph needs to be rewritten. It's not completely clear what is going on here.]


> [!convention] Convention
> Signs + and -


In fact, the meaning of the signs - and + differs for free energy and potential. For free energy, - and + signify energy lost or gained from the system, a convention of thermodynamics. For potential, - and + signify an excess or deficiency of electronic charge, an electrostatic convention proposed by Benjamin Franklin even before the discovery of the electron. In most scientific discussions, this difference in meaning is not important, since the context, thermodynamic or electrostatic, is clear. But when one considers electrochemical cells, where both thermodynamic and electrostatic concepts are needed, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between these distinct usages.

We rationalize this difficulty by inventing a thermodynamic construct called the ==emf of the cell reaction==. This quantity is assigned to a reaction (not to the physical cell); hence, it has a directional aspect. In a formal way, we also associate each cell schematic with a particular cell reaction, such that the right electrode in the schematic always corresponds to reduction, and the left, to oxidation.

is associated with the opposite schematic,

$$
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
$$


> [!convention] convention
> Contents


The cell reaction emf, $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$, is defined as the electrostatic potential of the electrode written on the right in the cell schematic with respect to that on the left. 

[Exercise 8 Part A]
For example, in cell (2.1.17), the measured potential difference is 0.985 V , and the zinc electrode is negative; thus, the emf of reaction 2.1.22, the spontaneous process, is +0.985 V . Likewise, the emf corresponding to (2.1.23), the reverse of (2.1.22), is -0.985 V . By adopting this convention, we have managed to rationalize an (observable) electrostatic quantity (the cell potential difference), which is not sensitive to the direction of the cell's operation, with a (defined) thermodynamic quantity (the Gibbs free energy), which is sensitive to that direction. One can completely avoid confusion over sign conventions of cell potentials if one understands this formal relationship between electrostatic measurements and thermodynamic concepts (3, 4).

Because our convention implies a positive emf when a reaction is spontaneous, [state what you're showing here more clearly; are you saying this result came from that fact?]

### Thermodynamic Quantities from Cell emf

[It's not really clear what the point of this passage is. Are there equations or expressions that I am supposed to learn from this? A technique? Is this an important derivation that will be used over and over again in this book? Or is it simply demonstrating the interconnection between thermodynamic quantities and electrochemical measurements, which exists due to the work that we've done before this section? I think this passage needs to be written a little more clearly so we clearly know what we are trying to accomplish here.]

Once the cell-reaction emf has been linked to the Gibbs free energy change, electrochemical measurements can be used to obtain other thermodynamic quantities for the same reaction, not just $\Delta G$.


> [!exercise] Exercise 9: Extracting $\Delta S$, $\Delta H$, and $K$ from $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}(T)$
> For a cell reaction that transfers $n$ electrons and is assigned a reaction emf $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$, use the relation $\Delta G=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ to connect electrochemical measurements to thermodynamic quantities.
> 
> **Part A:** Show how $\Delta S=-\left(\frac{\partial \Delta G}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}$ leads to an expression for $\Delta S$ in terms of $\left(\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}$.
> 
> **Part B:** Use $\Delta H=\Delta G+T\Delta S$ to obtain an expression for $\Delta H$ in terms of $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ and $\left(\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}$.
> 
> **Part C:** Under standard-state conditions, use $\Delta G^{0}=-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ together with $\Delta G^{0}=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ to write an expression relating $K_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ to $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$.


Other thermodynamic quantities can be derived from electrochemical measurements now that we have linked the potential difference across the cell to the free energy. For example, the entropy change in the cell reaction is given by the temperature dependence of $\Delta G$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta S=-\left(\frac{\partial \Delta G}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}=n F\left(\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}} \tag{2.1.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta H=\Delta G+T \Delta S=n F\left[T\left(\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}-E_{\mathrm{rxn}}\right] \tag{2.1.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

The equilibrium constant of the reaction is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
R T \ln K_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-\Delta G^{0}=n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} \tag{2.1.29}
\end{equation*}
$$


> [!Lessons] Thermodynamic Quantities from Cell emf
> **Lesson 1:** Once $\Delta G=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ is established, the temperature dependence of $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ provides an experimental route to entropy changes via $\Delta S=n F\left(\frac{\partial E_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\partial T}\right)_{\mathrm{P}}$.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Enthalpy changes can be obtained electrochemically by combining $\Delta H=\Delta G+T\Delta S$ with $\Delta G=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$, so that $\Delta H$ depends on both $E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ and its temperature coefficient.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Standard-state equilibrium constants can be extracted from standard emfs: $\Delta G^{0}=-R T\ln K_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ links $K_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ directly to a measurable standard potential.



These relations allow computation of electrochemical properties from thermochemical data. Several problems following this chapter illustrate the usefulness of that approach. Large tabulations of thermodynamic quantities exist (5-8).

## 2.1.4 Half-Reactions and Standard Electrode Potentials

Since the overall cell reaction comprises two independent half-reactions, one might think it reasonable that the cell potential could be broken into two individual electrode potentials. Indeed, a self-consistent set of half-reaction emfs and half-cell potentials can be devised, but the process is complicated by an experimental constraint.

Experimentally, one can measure a potential difference only between two electronic conductors of the same composition (Section 2.2.3). In electrochemistry, this limitation requires that one always work with whole cells of two electrodes, connected to the measuring device (e.g., a high-impedance voltmeter) via contacts having the same composition. Despite this constraint, a useful scale for individual half-cells can be constructed, if one refers electrode potentials and half-reaction emfs to a standard reference electrode featuring a standard half-reaction.

The primary reference, chosen by convention, is the ==normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)==, also called the ==standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)==:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(a=1) / \mathrm{H}^{+}(a=1) \tag{2.1.30}
\end{equation*}
$$
[Are the next two sentences a convention? Should we wrap them in a convention delimiter?]
Its potential is taken as zero at all temperatures. The standard emfs of the half-reactions,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{2.1.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

have also been assigned values of zero at all temperatures.


One can record half-cell potentials by measuring them in whole cells against the NHE [Section 2.1.8(a)]. 



> [!exercise] Exercise 10: Assigning a standard electrode potential vs. NHE
> Consider the cell (2.1.32), measured under standard-state conditions:
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> \mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(a=1) / \mathrm{H}^{+}(a=1) / / \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a=1) / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.1.32}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> The cell potential is $0.799~\mathrm{V}$, and the silver electrode is positive.
> 
> **Part A:** Determine the standard electrode potential $E_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}/\mathrm{Ag}}^{0}$ (as a reduction potential) vs. NHE.
> 
> **Part B:** State the standard emf for the reduction $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}$ and for the oxidation $\mathrm{Ag}\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e$, both referenced to NHE, and explain the sign change.



For example, in the system

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(a=1) / \mathrm{H}^{+}(a=1) / / \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a=1) / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.1.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

the cell potential is 0.799 V , and silver is positive. Thus, we say that the standard potential of the $\mathrm{Ag}^{+} / \mathrm{Ag}$ couple is +0.799 V vs. NHE . Moreover, the standard emf of the $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$reduction is also +0.799 V vs. NHE , but that of the Ag oxidation is -0.799 V vs. NHE. Another valid expression is that the standard electrode potential of $\mathrm{Ag}^{+} / \mathrm{Ag}$ is +0.799 V vs. NHE . To sum all of this up, we write: ${ }^{4}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag} \quad E_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+} / \mathrm{Ag}}^{0}=+0.799 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \tag{2.1.33}
\end{equation*}
$$


> [!Lessons] Standard Electrode Potentials vs. NHE
> **Lesson 1:** Electrode-potential tables are standardized by writing half-reactions as reductions; the tabulated $E^{0}$ value corresponds to the reduction as written, and the oxidation emf is the negative of that value.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** A reported standard electrode potential is always a reference statement: “$E^{0}=+0.799~\mathrm{V}$ vs. NHE” means the right-hand electrode is at higher potential than the NHE under standard-state conditions for the written reduction.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Keep “measured electrode potential vs. a reference” distinct from “emf assigned to a written overall reaction”: the former is what a voltmeter reads for a specific cell configuration, while the latter is a constructed thermodynamic quantity used to assign signs to $\Delta G$.



> [!rule]
> For the general system, (2.1.16), the electrostatic potential of the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ electrode (with respect to NHE) and the emf for the reduction of O always coincide. 


Therefore, one can condense the electrostatic and thermodynamic information into one list by tabulating electrode potentials and writing the half-reactions as reductions. [I'm not really sure what this means. Are there exercises and or problems where we do this? If so, that should be stated here.] Appendix C provides some frequently encountered potentials. Reference (5) is an authoritative general source for aqueous systems.

Such tables are extremely useful, because they present much chemical and electrical information very compactly. A few electrode potentials can characterize many cells and reactions. Since the potentials are indices of free energies, they are also ready means for evaluating equilibrium constants, complexation constants, and solubility products. Also, they can be taken in linear combinations to supply electrochemical information about additional half-reactions. One can tell from a glance at an ordered list of potentials whether a given redox process will proceed spontaneously. [are there problems or examples below in which we practice all or some of the skills listed here?]

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to grasp that electrostatic potential (not emf) is the measurable experimental variable.  [So if you measure electrostatic potential in an experiment, then from that, can you get emf? I think that is what this is implying?] 


> [!NOTE]
> When a half-reaction is chemically reversible, the potential of its electrode will usually remain in the same neighborhood and retain the same sign, whether the reaction proceeds as an oxidation or a reduction (9) **Sections 1.1.7(f) and 1.3.2(b)**.



## 2.1.5 Standard States and Activity

==Standard thermodynamic quantities== (e.g., ==standard free energies of formation== for various substances) correspond to situations in which all species of interest, including all participants in any reaction, are in their standard states. Likewise, the ==standard potential of a cell or half-reaction== is defined for conditions where all species are in their standard states (10). This provision is necessary because many thermodynamic quantities, such as the free energy of a solute, depend on concentration. 


> [!convention] Title
> Contents


To provide meaningful tabulations, one must specify the concentrations. It is helpful to adopt a standard practice-that is, to define standard states systematically. Standard thermodynamic quantities are marked with a superscript zero, e.g., $\Delta G^{0}$ (the standard free energy change for a reaction) or $E^{0}$ (the standard potential for an electrode).


The definitions of standard state are straightforward, but idealized: ${ }^{5}$

- ==standard state of a pure solid==: For a pure solid or liquid, the standard state is the substance under the standard pressure of $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ (1 bar). For solids, it is necessary to specify the allotrope or crystalline form.
- ==standard state of a pure gas==: For a pure gas, the standard state is the gas under standard pressure, but behaving as an ideal gas.
- ==standard state of a solute==: For a solute, the standard state is a solution of standard concentration under standard pressure, but behaving as though each solute molecule is infinitely diluted. The standard concentration is often 1 M or 1 m (molal), if either such measure is normal for the system;

[^3]alternatively, it [what is "it"?] could be a partial pressure of $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ for a gaseous solute or unit mole fraction for a component in an alloy or any other system well described by mole fraction. [It's not really clear what's being said here.]

> [!NOTE]
> The idealization of the standard states for gases and solutes is meant to produce a conceptual condition in which each gas molecule or condensed-phase solute is independent, apart from its interaction with the diluent (solvent in the case of a solution, free space for a gas). In reality, species in a gas at $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ or solutes in a system with molar-level concentration are affected by neighboring entities (like themselves or different), because neighbors are close enough to exert forces on each other and to mutually affect environments. When such interactions are significant, the properties of a standard state must be determined by extrapolation based on progressive dilution to remove such effects.



Of course, one usually wants to work under conditions where concentrations or partial pressures differ from the standard. Thermodynamic relationships can accommodate such situations if one expresses each concentration or partial pressure in terms of an activity, $a_{j}$, defined for a dissolved or gaseous species $j$ as

> [!equation] Activity definition (solute and gas)
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> a_{j}=\gamma_{j} C_{j} / C_{j}^{0} \quad a_{j}=\gamma_{j} P_{j} / P_{j}^{0} \tag{2.1.34a,b}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $C_{j}$ is the concentration (or $P_{j}$ is the partial pressure) of species $j, C_{j}^{0}$ is the standard-state concentration (or $P_{j}^{0}$ is the standard-state partial pressure) of that species, and $\gamma_{j}$ is the activity coefficient.

> [!rule]
> For an ideal system, in which each entity is independent, the activity coefficient is unity, and $a_{j}$ is just the concentration or partial pressure scaled to that of the standard state. 



> [!exercise] Exercise 11: Computing activity from concentration in an ideal solution
> A solute $j$ is present in an ideal aqueous solution at a concentration of $1~\mathrm{mM}$. The standard-state concentration for solutes is $C_{j}^{0}=1~\mathrm{M}$.
> 
> Compute the activity $a_{j}$ of the solute.


For example, a solute in an ideal 1 mM solution would have an activity of $10^{-3}$, given the common standard-state concentration of 1 M . 


> [!rule]
> Activity is unitless; $C_{j}$ or $P_{j}$ must always be expressed in the units used to define the standard state.

The activity coefficient reflects the nonidealities of a real system by accounting for the way in which the free energy of a solute or gas molecule is environmentally altered. As solutions become more dilute (or as pressures are reduced in gaseous systems), the systems become more ideal, and activity coefficients approach unity. ${ }^{6}$

Theories exist to predict the values of activity coefficients. The best known is the ==Debye-Hückel theory==, which applies to dilute solutions of fully dissociated electrolytes $(2,11)$. It predicts that the activity coefficient of a given ionic species depends on its charge and size, the charges and concentrations of all other ions, and the dielectric constant of the solvent. The activity coefficient is unity in the limit of infinite dilution, but becomes progressively smaller as the ionic population rises from zero. For relatively dilute solutions, the Debye-Hückel theory predicts that,


> [!Equation] Debye–Hückel equation (extended form)
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> \log \gamma_{j}=\frac{-A z_{j}^{2} I^{1 / 2}}{1+B d_{j} I^{1 / 2}} \tag{2.1.35}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $z_{j}$ is the charge on species $j, d_{j}$ is its effective solvated diameter, and $I$ is the ==volume ionic strength==,

> [!equation] Volume ionic strength
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> I=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathrm{m}} z_{\mathrm{m}}^{2} C_{\mathrm{m}} \tag{2.1.36}
> \end{equation*}
> $$

In (2.1.36), the sum runs over all ionic species in the system, and the $C_{\mathrm{m}}$ are molar concentrations. The constants $A$ and $B$ in (2.1.35) depend on the dielectric constant of the solvent and the temperature. For aqueous solutions at $298 \mathrm{~K}, A=0.509 \mathrm{M}^{-1 / 2}$ and $B=3.29 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1} \mathrm{M}^{-1 / 2}$.

**Table 2.1.1** provides some predictions of the theory, illustrating the effects of various factors. Activity coefficients can depart substantially from the ideal (unity) for species that are highly charged or physically large, or if the ionic strength is high. They also become progressively less ideal in solvents of lower dielectric constant. Neutral species remain nearly ideal under the conditions being discussed here.

> [!Rule]
> The Debye-Hückel theory is quantitatively valid only for fully dissociated ionic species at ionic strengths below 0.1 M. 

In more concentrated media, the behavior of activity coefficients can be complex, as shown in Figure 2.1.1. ${ }^{7}$ The direction of change with ionic strength can reverse, and the activity coefficients can even become much larger than unity. The behavior is discussed much more fully in the specialized thermodynamic literature (2).

For solutes in practical electrochemical media (e.g., 0.5 M aqueous KCl or $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{TBABF}_{4}$ in $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}$ ), activity coefficients are often unknown and are not readily obtained. In electrochemical research, one often must either neglect activity effects or accommodate their effect in some general way (as we will soon see with formal potentials in Section 2.1.7).

> [!exercise] Exercise 12: Deriving the Nernst equation from $\Delta G$

> 
> **Part A:** Starting from the thermodynamic relation for $\Delta G$ in terms of a reaction quotient written with activities, derive an expression for the cell emf $E$ in terms of activities.

Consider a general cell in which the half-reaction at the right-hand electrode is

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{O}} \mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons v_{\mathrm{R}} \mathrm{R} \tag{2.1.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the $v_{j}$ are stoichiometric coefficients. If the left side of the cell is an NHE, the cell reaction is then

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \mathrm{H}_{2}+v_{\mathrm{O}} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow v_{\mathrm{R}} \mathrm{R}+v_{\mathrm{H}^{+}} \mathrm{H}^{+} \tag{2.1.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.1</span> Experimentally determined mean ionic activity coefficients vs. concentration [in molal units (mol per kg of solvent)]. Data are for aqueous solution; molar concentrations below 1 M are similar to molal values. Debye-Hückel theory applies only in the shaded area to the left. In that region, the values of $\gamma_{ \pm \pm}$are close to the figures presented for the cations in Table 2.1.1. [Data from Moore (13).]

and its free energy change is given from basic thermodynamics (2) by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G=\Delta G^{0}+R T \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{R}}^{v_{\mathrm{R}}} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{v_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}}}{a_{\mathrm{O}}^{v_{\mathrm{O}}} a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{v_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}} \tag{2.1.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a_{j}$ is the activity of species $j^{8}$ Since $\Delta G=-n F E$ and $\Delta G^{0}=-n F E^{0}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}-\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{R}}^{v_{\mathrm{R}}} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{v_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}}}{a_{\mathrm{O}}^{v_{\mathrm{O}}} a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{v_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}} \tag{2.1.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

but since $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=1$,




$$\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{O}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{a_{\mathrm{R}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}} \tag{2.1.41}
\end{equation*}$$



This relation, the Nernst equation, furnishes the potential of the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ electrode vs. NHE as a function of the activities of O and R . In addition, it defines the activity dependence of the emf for reaction 2.1.37.



> [!Lessons] From Activities to the Nernst Equation
> **Lesson 1:** The Nernst equation is the electrochemical form of $\Delta G=\Delta G^{0}+R T\ln Q$: combining with $\Delta G=-n F E$ yields $E=E^{0}-\frac{R T}{n F}\ln Q$, where $Q$ must be written in terms of activities.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Reaction quotients must be dimensionless. Using activities ensures the logarithm argument is unitless, whereas raw concentrations or pressures require normalization by the standard state.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Reference-electrode assumptions simplify $Q$. For an NHE reference, $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=1$ removes hydrogen terms so the electrode potential depends only on the activities of the redox couple and other explicit participants.



The emf of any cell reaction, in terms of the electrode potentials of the two half-reactions, is

> [!equation] Cell-reaction emf from electrode potentials
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> E_{\mathrm{rxn}}=E_{\mathrm{right}}-E_{\mathrm{left}} \tag{2.1.42}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $E_{\text {right }}$ and $E_{\text {left }}$ refer to the cell schematic and are given by the appropriate Nernst equations. The cell potential is the magnitude of this value.

The functional form of the Nernst equation varies to suit the reaction. For example, if a half-reaction involves participants other than O and R , such as ligands or protons, its Nernst [^6]equation must reflect the added complexity. The general form of the Nernst equation for an electrode and for the corresponding reductive half-reaction is



> [!equation] Nernst equation (general activity form)
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> E=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\prod_{j}^{\text {O side }} a_{j}^{\nu_{j}}}{\prod_{j}^{\text {R side }} a_{j}^{\nu_{j}}} \tag{2.1.43}
> \end{equation*}
> $$

in which the top and bottom products run, respectively, over all participants on the O and R sides of the half reaction. Since activities are unitless, the argument of the logarithm remains unitless, regardless of the number and powers of activities it comprehends.

## 2.1.7 Formal Potentials

It is usually inconvenient to deal with activities in evaluations of half-cell potentials, because activity coefficients are almost always unknown. A device for avoiding them is the ==formal potential==, $E^{0^{\prime}}$, which is the measured potential of a half-cell (vs. NHE) when

- Species O and R are present at concentrations such that $[\mathrm{O}]^{v} \mathrm{O} /[\mathrm{R}]^{v} \mathrm{R}$ is numerically unity, where $[\mathrm{O}]$ and $[\mathrm{R}]$ represent the total unitless molar concentrations of species O and R in all equilibrated chemical forms (e.g., solvated, protonated to various degrees, or complexed in various degrees).
- Other substances, such as, components of the medium, are present at designated concentrations.


> [!exercise] Exercise 13: Using a formal potential to avoid explicit activity coefficients
> Using the definition of the formal potential $E^{0^{\prime}}$ given in this section, rewrite the activity-form Nernst equation (2.1.41) for a couple of the form (2.1.37) in a concentration form that uses bracketed concentrations $[\mathrm{O}]$ and $[\mathrm{R}]$ (as in Eq. (2.1.44)).
> 
> State clearly what experimental/definitional condition makes $E=E^{0^{\prime}}$ in this formal-potential convention.


For a reaction like (2.1.37), this definition allows us to write,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{O}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{a_{\mathrm{R}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}}=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{O}]^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{[\mathrm{R}]^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}} \tag{2.1.44}
\end{equation*}
$$



> [!exercise] Exercise 14: Separating activity and concentration contributions in the Nernst equation
> Starting from the activity-based Nernst equation for the $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$ couple (Eq. (2.1.41)), factor the activities into activity coefficients and normalized concentrations to obtain an expression of the form (2.1.45).
> 
> For the simple case in which the only forms present are solvated $\mathrm{O}$ and solvated $\mathrm{R}$, identify the corresponding expression for the formal potential $E^{0^{\prime}}$ (as in Eq. (2.1.46)).


At the least, the formal potential incorporates the standard potential and some activity coefficients; however, it also frequently includes chemical factors, such as equilibrium constants and concentrations of ligands.

To understand more fully, let us rewrite (2.1.41) so that the activity coefficients are factored out of the second term:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{O}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{\gamma_{\mathrm{R}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\left(C_{\mathrm{O}} / C^{0}\right)^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{\left(C_{\mathrm{R}} / C^{0}\right)^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}} \tag{2.1.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the system is simple, so that solvated O and solvated R are the only forms present, then $C_{\mathrm{O}} / C^{0}=[\mathrm{O}]$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}} / C^{0}=[\mathrm{R}],{ }^{9}$ and by comparison with (2.1.44), we find that $E^{0^{\prime}}$ is just the first two terms of (2.1.45),

$$
\begin{equation*}
E^{0^{\prime}}=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{O}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{O}}}}{\gamma_{\mathrm{R}}^{\nu_{\mathrm{R}}}} \tag{2.1.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is a common situation.

>

[^7]For example, consider

\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \tag{2.1.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

in $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HClO}_{4}$. In the rightmost form of (2.1.44), the Nernst equation becomes simply

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]} \tag{2.1.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the formal potential is

> **Lesson 2:** Because $E^{0^{\prime}}$ includes medium-dependent effects (ionic strength, supporting electrolyte, and sometimes complexation), it is specific to the stated conditions and is not a universal constant for a redox couple.

In the case of

The Nernst equation based on the formal potential is

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
E^{0^{\prime}}=E^{0}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \gamma_{\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}} \tag{2.1.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

There is no factor for metallic Cu in either (2.1.51) or (2.1.52), because both its activity and activity coefficient are unity.

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Table C. 2</span> lists formal potentials for the $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ couple in $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}, 10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}, 1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HClO}_{4}$, $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and $2 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$. Standard potentials for half-reactions and cells are, in fact, determined by measuring formal potentials at different ionic strengths and extrapolating to zero ionic strength.

Often $E^{0^{\prime}}$ also contains factors related to complexation or ion pairing, as it does in fact for the $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ couple in $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ solutions. Both iron species are complexed in these media; hence, (2.1.47) does not accurately describe the half-cell reaction, which is better expressed in the form of (1.1.24). The bracketed concentrations, [ Fe (III)] and [ Fe (II)], can be readily understood and defined, but are made up of ferric and ferrous species complexed in varying, generally unknown, degrees. By relying on the empirical formal potentials, one can sidestep the need for detailed description of the related equilibria.

In other situations, one can define $E^{0^{\prime}}$ explicitly and can exploit it to obtain information about homogeneous equilibria associated with an electrode reaction. An example is found in Problem 7.12.

## 2.1.8 Reference Electrodes

### (a) The NHE and Classic Hydrogen Electrodes

A
> [!Questions] Title
> Contents


So far in this chapter, we have used the NHE exclusively as the reference for potential, because it is the thermodynamic standard. However, an NHE cannot actually be constructed, because it requires that $a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=1$, implying ideal behavior in the gas and the solution. A real hydrogen electrode can approximate an NHE, and measurements against the NHE can be achieved by extrapolating results using the real electrode to infinite dilution of the electrolyte. The overall process has been clearly described (11). Such painstaking measurements have been essential to the history of electrochemical thermodynamics, including the establishment of the potential scale.


> [!Questions] Title
> Contents


A real hydrogen electrode can be constructed as illustrated on the left side of Figure 1.1.1b. A Pt electrode is immersed in an aqueous electrolyte having a known concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, then $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is bubbled through the solution near the Pt . Normally, the Pt electrode has been "platinized," i.e., electrodeposited with Pt by reduction in chloroplatinic acid solution. Platinization greatly increases the surface area of the electrode and improves the kinetics of the heterogeneous reaction, $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2}$. Classic hydrogen electrodes like these are well behaved and reproducible; however, they are also cumbersome, so they are rarely used for general laboratory work.

More convenient reference electrodes are employed for daily measurements. The remainder of this section covers the critical properties of reference electrodes and the most widely used options. The Lab Note in this chapter (Section 2.5) covers some practicalities. Much greater detail is available in authoritative reviews (15-19).

### (b) Attributes of Practical Reference Electrodes

A reference electrode for routine use in the laboratory must:

1) Adopt a predictable potential with precision and hold that potential reliably over time.
2) Be packaged conveniently for insertion into a cell, for removal, and for storage, so that it can be reused easily over a long lifetime.
3) Make satisfactory ionic contact with the working solution.
4) Not contaminate the solution at the working electrode or become contaminated by that solution.
5) Accept any current required by the role of the reference electrode in the cell without significant change of potential.

Reference electrodes that satisfy the Attribute 1 are ==well poised==, meaning that they are based on an electrochemical equilibrium between an electrode and both redox forms of a kinetically facile redox couple. Such an equilibrium is the basis of predictability, precision, and stability. Many reference electrodes also embody a secondary equilibrium (commonly a solubility equilibrium) that can stabilize the activities of participants in the electrode reaction other than the redox species themselves. Section 2.1.8(c) provides examples.

Packaging often resembles that shown for the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ reference in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 1.5.4a</span>. The active electrode material and the internal electrolyte are typically contained in a glass or plastic envelope having a plastic cap bearing a sturdy conductor to which external connection can be made repeatedly by clip-lead. Reference electrodes are often fabricated in the laboratory for local use, but many are also purchased commercially. Of course, any packaging must be inert and insoluble in the working solutions to be used.

Contact between the internal electrolyte of the reference electrode and the working solution is established through an ionically conducting element at the tip of the reference electrode assembly. In most cases, porous glass or porous ceramic is employed; however, an ionically conducting polymer, a porous polymer membrane, a frit, or a fiber might be used instead. The tip material must be inert and insoluble in the working solution. The issues of contamination raised in Attribute 4 can be very significant, because leakage can be expected in both directions at the tip. See Section 2.5.1 for a practical discussion of leakage.

Attribute 5, relating to the acceptance of current by the reference electrode, is usually not a concern in contemporary practice with three-electrode cells, because the only current through the reference cell is that required for continuous measurement of the potential (Sections 1.5.3 and 1.5.4). Present-day instrumentation handles this function with very high input impedance (Section 16.4); hence, that current is tiny, and the reference electrode remains negligibly polarized. However, the picture can be different for experiments in two-electrode cells, where the reference electrode is also the counter electrode. In this case, the reference electrode must accept all of the current flowing at the working electrode. Depending on the size of the working electrode, the demand on the reference electrode can range from negligible to very significant. It can be helpful to use a reference electrode of larger area and with greater amounts of each redox component. In the historic literature (into the 1960s), reference electrodes were often the
counter electrodes in two-electrode cells. They sometimes had to handle quite a bit of current, so they were large by current standards, with sizable electrodes and substantial masses of any solids in equilibrium.

### (c) Aqueous Reference Electrodes Based on Solubility Equilibria



Many practical reference electrodes are based on solubility equilibria involving aqueous electrolytes. The most widely used, by far, is $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ with saturated KCl as the electrolyte: [Is there a name for this electrode? Like the silver chloride electrode or something like that. If so, the formal name should be written here.]

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{KCl}(\text { sat'd }) \quad E_{\text {ref }}=0.197 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \tag{2.1.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

The potential given here is that recommended in references on the basis of direct measurements $(16,18,19) .^{10}$ This electrode is available from many commercial sources, but is also easily fabricated in the laboratory by anodizing a silver wire in a concentrated KCl solution, then packaging the electrode and electrolyte generally as shown in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 1.5.4a</span>. The solubility equilibria for KCl and AgCl assure that the activities of $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$remain fixed at constant temperature, giving the reference electrode a stable potential. There is a modest temperature coefficient for the reference potential, but it is not an issue for most work.


The ==saturated calomel electrode (SCE)==,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{KCl}(\text { sat'd }) \quad E_{\text {ref }}=0.244 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \tag{2.1.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

was, for decades, the reigning practical reference ( $15-18$ ). ${ }^{10,11}$ A great fraction of the literature published before the 1980s involves potential scales referenced to this electrode. In recent years, it has lost out to $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$, because (a) its construction is more complicated than that of $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$, (b) it is bulkier and more awkward to use, and (c) it is based on Hg , whose toxicity has generated greater concern. Even so, the SCE remains commercially available and fairly widely used, especially with ion-selective electrodes (Section 2.4), because it is very well behaved. Like the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrode, the SCE rests on solubility equilibria to fix the activities of the ionic species involved in the electrode reaction $\left(\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$. The potential of the SCE varies with temperature, somewhat more strongly than for $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$.



One also finds use in the literature of the ==normal calomel electrode (NCE)== (15, 18, 19): ${ }^{10}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{KCl}(1 \mathrm{M}) \tag{2.1.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

$$
E_{\mathrm{ref}}=0.280 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

When even minor leakage of chloride is not acceptable, a ==mercurous sulfate electrode== may be used $(16,19):^{10}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} / \mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\text { sat'd }) \quad E_{\text {ref }}=0.651 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \tag{2.1.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

For strongly basic working solutions, a ==mercuric oxide electrode== might be preferable (20, 21):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{HgO} / \mathrm{NaOH}(0.1 \mathrm{~m}) \quad E_{\mathrm{ref}}=0.164 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \tag{2.1.57}
\end{equation*}
$$



### (d) Reversible Hydrogen Electrode

Classic hydrogen electrodes were discussed above with the concluding comment that they are generally too cumbersome for routine work. Even so, they are used in situations where [^8]investigators desire to avoid introducing ionic or solvent contamination from a reference electrode tip. The arrangement is just as described previously, so that the reference electrode can be written
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \text { /aqueous test solution of known } \mathrm{pH} / \tag{2.1.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

The platinized Pt electrode is inserted directly into a sample of the solution used at the working electrode called the "==test solution==" in (2.1.58). The pH of the test solution must be well defined, either by buffering or by adequate concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Molecular hydrogen is a necessary solute at the reference electrode, but must usually be kept from the working electrode; therefore, a porous separator, such as a frit, would be interposed. If the ionic composition on both sides of the separator is the same, there would be no liquid junction potential (Section 2.3).

This reference is called a ==reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)==. 


> [!NOTE]
> It is not the same as an NHE (SHE), which is a concept, not a realizable device.



The potential of the RHE is given by


> [!equation] Reversible hydrogen electrode potential (activity form)
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> E_{\mathrm{RHE}}=E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0}+\frac{2.303 R T}{2 F} \log \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{2}}{a_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}} \tag{2.1.59}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

If the gas is taken as ideal, then we obtain

> [!equation] Reversible hydrogen electrode potential (ideal-gas form)

> \begin{equation*}

> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ is the partial pressure of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $P^{0}$ is the standard-state pressure ( 1 bar or $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ ).

Commercial versions of the RHE are available, the designers of which have worked to eliminate the need for the hydrogen gas bottle supporting the classic hydrogen electrode. These devices have internal hydrogen supplies (generally electrolytically generated), which deliver $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ through a platinized gas diffusion electrode. They are as compact as many of the more common reference electrodes. ${ }^{12}$

### (e) Reference Electrodes for Nonaqueous Systems

With nonaqueous solvents like acetonitrile, methylene chloride, or DMF, one might be concerned especially with the leakage of water from an aqueous reference electrode, because water is a reactant toward electrogenerated species that one commonly desires to investigate in an aprotic environment. In that case, a reference electrode such as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ag}^{+}\left(0.01 \mathrm{M} \text { in } \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}\right) \tag{2.1.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

might be preferred [is this called a silver silver electrode?]. Such an electrode can be packaged much like the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrode in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 1.5.4a</span>; however, the internal electrolyte may need periodic renewal because of the volatility of $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CN}$. Normally, $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$would be introduced as the perchlorate or tetrafluoroborate salt.

Electrodes like these are available commercially in kit form, allowing the user to fill the electrode with an $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$solution in the solvent actually chosen for the cell.

Much work in nonaqueous media is carried out with ==quasireference electrodes (QRE)==, covered in Section 2.5.2.

### (f) Interconversion of Scales

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.2</span> shows the relationship between the NHE, $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$, and SCE scales. Also shown are potentials on the "absolute scale" and the corresponding Fermi energies, which are concepts introduced in Section 2.2.5.

[^9]!

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.2</span> Potentials on the NHE, Ag/AgCl, SCE, and "absolute" scales, together with corresponding Fermi energies.

The standard potentials of some couples can be measured vs. NHE with a precision better than 1 mV , so one will sometimes see values legitimately reported to four decimal places (as in Table C.1).


> [!rule]
> However, it is generally inappropriate to convert or to report any electrode potential to four decimal places vs. $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ or SCE, because the potential of either of these reference electrodes, in practical form and use, is uncertain by a millivolt or more [Sections 2.1.8(c) and 2.3.5].


## 2.1.9 Potential-pH Diagrams and Thermodynamic Predictions

We learned in Section 2.1.4 that half-cell potentials are useful for characterizing the behavior of electrochemical cells and for evaluating the spontaneity of reactions. ==Potential-pH diagrams== (also called ==Pourbaix diagrams==) are graphical representations of half-cell potentials useful for predicting the behavior of systems (22).


> [!Questions] Title
> Contents


In these diagrams, the potential vs. NHE is represented vertically, and the pH , horizontally. A half-reaction that involves transfer of electrons and protons appears as a sloping line on this diagram. The potential is given by the corresponding Nernst equation, where the activities of all species other than $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$are assumed to have unit value. Thus, the generic reaction involving reduction of an oxidized form, O , to the reduced form, R , with involvement of protons,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+q \mathrm{H}^{+}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R} \tag{2.1.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

is represented by

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}+2.303 q(R T / n F) \log a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=E^{0}-0.059(q / n) \mathrm{pH} \quad(\mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE }) \tag{2.1.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

On a graph of $E$ vs. pH , this equation describes a line with a slope of $-59(q / n) \mathrm{mV}$ per pH unit (at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and an intercept at $\mathrm{pH}=0$ of $E^{0}$. An electron-transfer half-reaction that does not involve protons is represented by a horizontal line at $E=E^{0}$. Purely acid-base reactions are represented by vertical lines, because such processes have no potential dependence.



> [!Lessons] Interpreting Potential–pH (Pourbaix) Diagrams
> **Lesson 1:** Potential–pH boundaries are Nernst lines. Proton-coupled electron-transfer reactions produce sloped lines with slope set by the proton/electron stoichiometry (e.g., $-0.059(q/n)~\mathrm{V}$ per pH unit at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$).
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Horizontal lines correspond to redox equilibria with no proton involvement, and vertical lines correspond to acid–base or solubility equilibria with no electron transfer.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** The diagram is a thermodynamic summary built under stated activity assumptions (often unit activity for species not explicitly varied); interpreting a line requires knowing which activities were held at unity.


### (a) $\mathrm{E}-\mathrm{pH}$ Diagram for Water

One can illustrate this approach with the $E-\mathrm{pH}$ diagram for water (Figure 2.1.3), assuming that reduction produces hydrogen,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{H}^{+}+e \rightleftharpoons 1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \quad \quad E^{0}=0.0 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \tag{2.1.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

and oxidation produces oxygen,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 e \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad E^{0}=1.229 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \tag{2.1.65}
\end{equation*}
$$

From the generic expression, (2.1.63), these reactions are presented on the diagram as the two lines

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=0.0-0.059 \mathrm{pH} \quad(\text { line } \mathrm{A}) \tag{2.1.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

and

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=1.229-0.059 \mathrm{pH} \quad(\text { line } B) \tag{2.1.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

Equations 2.1.66 and 2.1.67 can be used to compute the reversible potentials for reduction and oxidation of water as a function of pH .

A Potential-pH diagram is sometimes called a ==predominance area diagram==, because it indicates which species predominates in each ==predominance area== at a selected pH and potential. For example, water is thermodynamically stable between the two lines in Figure 2.1.3, but oxygen predominates in the area above the water oxidation line, and hydrogen predominates in the area below the water

![[Pasted image 20260222102518.png]]


<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.3</span> Potential-pH diagram for the water system. The reactions corresponding to the arrows are important chemical processes: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$). Arrows just show the direction of change; the reactions can take place up and down the pH scale.

reduction line. These two products of water electrolysis receive the focus here because they are the most stable thermodynamically and generally are found in actual experiments. However, one might well ask about other possible species generated by the oxidation or reduction of water or oxygen, such as superoxide ion, $\mathrm{O}_{2} \bar{\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. We will discuss this matter later, when we cover the limitations of thermodynamic predictions.

### (b) $\mathrm{E}-\mathrm{pH}$ Diagram for Iron

Diagrams are available for most elements and some alloys in compilations (22), encyclopedias (7), and journal publications. The one for Fe (<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.4</span>) is particularly useful, because it bears on the corrosion of this important material.


> [!exercise] Exercise 17: Constructing boundaries in an $E$–pH diagram (iron)
> Use <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.4</span> and the half-reactions in Eq. (2.1.69) to interpret and construct boundaries in the iron $E$–pH diagram. Assume activities of pure solids and of liquid water are unity, and assume unit activity for dissolved iron species when they appear in the diagram unless the boundary condition requires otherwise.
> 
> **Part A:** Explain why the boundaries corresponding to the two half-reactions in (2.1.69) are horizontal lines on an $E$–pH diagram, and state their potentials.
> 
> **Part B:** The precipitation of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ is governed by $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=4\times 10^{-38}=a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}a_{\mathrm{OH}^{-}}^{3}$. For a unit-activity $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ solution, determine the pH at which precipitation begins and describe how this fixes the location of the vertical boundary separating $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ from $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$.
> 
> **Part C:** For the boundary associated with reaction (2.1.70), derive the line equation in the form $E=E^{0}-m\,\mathrm{pH}$ (identify the slope $m$), and determine the corresponding $E^{0}$ by requiring that this line pass through the point where $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ can coexist at the precipitation pH from Part B.


In very acidic solutions, ferrous and ferric ions do not form insoluble hydroxides or oxides and the diagram is governed by the half-reactions

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe} & E^{0}=-0.44 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \\
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} & E^{0}=0.77 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \tag{2.1.69}
\end{array}
$$

Since these processes do not involve proton transfer, they are represented in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.4</span> as horizontal lines (A and B).

The $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ zone (above line A) extends rightward to a pH where the system will precipitate $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ or the hydrous oxide $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, according to the solubility product, $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=4 \times 10^{-38}= a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} a_{\mathrm{OH}^{-}}^{3}$. A unit-activity solution of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ (approximately 1 M ) will start to precipitate at


![[Pasted image 20260222102543.png]]

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.4</span> Potential-pH diagram for the iron system in water (solid lines). Line labels are discussed in the text. Dashed lines are for the water system. Predominance areas related to the latter are identified at the far right (upper line) or far left (lower line).

$\mathrm{pH}=1.5$. Since the solubility product expression does not involve electrons, the boundary between $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ is a vertical line at this pH (line C ). It does not extend below line A , where $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ predominates.

The reaction separating the zone of predominance for $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ from that for $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}+3 \mathrm{H}^{+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \tag{2.1.70}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is represented by the line

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}-(3) 0.059 \mathrm{pH} \tag{2.1.71}
\end{equation*}
$$

It must pass through the bottom right vertex of the zone for $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, where $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ can coexist. Given this point and the slope of -0.177 V per pH unit, one can draw line D . For half reaction 2.1.70, $E^{0}$ can be determined by extrapolating the line to $\mathrm{pH}=0$. By extrapolating to pH 14 , one can obtain $E^{0}$ for the reaction written in terms of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+3 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \tag{2.1.72}
\end{equation*}
$$

Ferrous iron also precipitates as the pH rises, in this case according to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \tag{2.1.73}
\end{equation*}
$$

with $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=1.6 \times 10^{-15}=a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} a_{\mathrm{OH}^{-}}^{2}$. Using the procedure employed above for precipitation of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, the result is a new vertical line ( E ) at $\mathrm{pH}=6.6$, representing the boundary between zones dominated by $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$. Its lower limit is the intersection with line B , because metallic iron predominates below line B . The upper limit is the intersection with line D , because $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ predominates above that point.

We still have two boundaries to place on the right side of the diagram, viz. that separating the zones for Fe and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ and that dividing the zones for $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$.

In the former case, the relevant process is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \tag{2.1.74}
\end{equation*}
$$

which gives rise to a boundary line having a slope of -0.059 V per pH unit. It must pass through the intersection point of lines B and E , where Fe and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ coexist. Given this point and the slope, we can draw boundary line F .

The last boundary corresponds to the process,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \tag{2.1.75}
\end{equation*}
$$

It also has a slope of -0.059 V per pH unit and must pass through the intersection of lines D and E . This is line G in Figure 2.1.4.

The number of zones and the precise locations of the boundaries depend upon the species used in the formulation of an $E-\mathrm{pH}$ diagram. For the iron system, for example, there are many types of iron oxides. Generally, the mineral form hematite, $\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, is used for the iron(III) oxide; however, other phases could also be included (e.g., magnetite, $\mathrm{Fe}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}$, a mixed $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})-\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})$ oxide). Also, higher oxidation states of Fe are stable in very alkaline solutions and might be shown in a very complete diagram.

The $E-\mathrm{pH}$ lines for water (<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.3</span>) are also included in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.4</span> and allow one to make predictions about reactions. For example, Fe (III) species lie in the potential region where oxygen is predominant, which indicates that metallic Fe would be oxidized (i.e., would corrode) in this region when exposed to oxygen. The diagram also indicates that elemental iron will dissolve as $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in acidic solutions, with production of hydrogen.



> [!Lessons] Making Thermodynamic Predictions with an $E$–pH Diagram
> **Lesson 1:** An $E$–pH diagram is used by locating the operating point (pH and potential) and identifying the predominance region; predicted corrosion/passivation/reduction behavior follows from which species is thermodynamically stable at that point.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Overlaying water-stability lines on a metal diagram helps identify regions where hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution is thermodynamically favored, providing immediate constraints on aqueous electrochemistry.


### (c) Limitations of Predictions from E-pH Diagrams

> [!Rule]
> Since the data in Pourbaix diagrams are purely thermodynamic, predictions are fully valid only for thermodynamically reversible systems. 



> [!exercise] Exercise 18: Limits of thermodynamic predictions from Pourbaix diagrams
> <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figures 2.1.3</span> and <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">2.1.4</span> are constructed from thermodynamic equilibria.
> 
> **Part A:** Explain why a prediction from a Pourbaix diagram is strictly valid only for thermodynamically reversible behavior, and identify what kind of information the diagram omits that can matter in real electrochemical experiments.
> 
> **Part B:** Using the water diagram (<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.3</span>) as an example, explain qualitatively why the onset of water splitting in practice generally requires additional driving force beyond the thermodynamic potential difference, and why the required extra driving force depends on electrode material.


For example, in the water diagram (<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.1.3</span>), if one interprets the lines as applying to all actual electrodes, one would assume that the water-splitting reaction to hydrogen and oxygen would always require 1.23 V under conditions of negligible cell resistance. However, this is never observed, because, as will be seen in the next chapter, kinetic limitations (lack of reversibility) require overpotentials to drive the reactions.

In fact, the actual electrochemical behavior depends critically on electrode material. The line between water and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ accurately describes behavior at a Pt electrode, but is very far off with Hg . There is no electrode material that allows reversible water oxidation. These matters are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.



> [!Lessons] What Pourbaix Diagrams Do (and Do Not) Predict
> **Lesson 1:** Pourbaix diagrams are equilibrium statements. They indicate which reactions are thermodynamically allowed, but they do not predict rates, required overpotentials, or whether a transformation will occur on an experimental time scale.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Kinetics and electrode material matter: real electrodes often require additional driving force beyond the thermodynamic potential because activation barriers and mass transport limit the reaction.
> 
> **Lesson 3:** Metastability is common in practice. A species can be thermodynamically unstable yet persist if the pathway to the stable products is kinetically hindered.
