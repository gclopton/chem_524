For the thermodynamic considerations of the previous section, we were not required to advance a mechanism for the observable differences in potentials across phase boundaries. However, a mechanistic concept aids chemical thinking, so let us now consider how these differences might arise.

## 2.2.1 The Physics of Phase Potentials

One can readily speak of the ==electric potential== ${ }^{13}$ at any point, $(x, y, z)$, within a phase. That quantity, $\phi(x, y, z)$, is defined in physics as the work required to bring a unit positive charge, without material interactions, from an infinite distance to $(x, y, z) .^{14}$ From electrostatics, we have assurance that $\phi(x, y, z)$ is independent of the path of the test charge (23). The work is done against a coulombic field; hence, we can express the electric potential generally as

> [!equation]
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> \phi(x, y, z)=\int_{\infty}^{x, y, z}-\mathcal{E} \cdot d \mathbf{l} \tag{2.2.1}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $\mathcal{E}$ is the electric field strength vector (i.e., the force exerted on a unit charge at any point), and $d \mathbf{l}$ is an infinitesimal tangent to the path in the direction of movement. The integral is carried out over any path to $(x, y, z)$. The difference in potential between points $\left(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}\right)$ and $(x, y, z)$ is then

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi\left(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}\right)-\phi(x, y, z)=\int_{x, y, z}^{x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}}-\mathcal{E} \cdot d \mathbf{l} \tag{2.2.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

> [!NOTE]
> In general, the electric field strength is not zero everywhere between two points and the integral does not vanish; hence, some potential difference usually exists.

A ==conducting phase==, such as a metal, a semiconductor, or an electrolyte solution, has mobile charge carriers. When no current passes through the phase (i.e., when it is at electrical equilibrium), there is no net movement of charge carriers, so the electric field at all interior points must be zero. If it were not, the carriers would move to eliminate the field. From (2.2.2), one can see that the difference in potential between any two points in the interior of the phase must also be zero under these conditions; thus, the entire phase is an equipotential volume. The electric [^10]potential applying at every interior location in a conducting phase, $\alpha$, at equilibrium is known as the ==inner potential== (or ==Galvani potential==), $\phi^{\alpha}$, of the phase. 

> [!Rule]
> For a phase not at electrical equilibrium, an inner potential is undefined. ${ }^{15}$

A principal factor determining the inner potential is any excess charge on the phase itself, because a test charge coming from an infinite distance would have to work against the coulombic field arising from that charge. The test charge might also have to work against other fields arising from charged bodies outside the sample. If so, they would also be contributors to the inner potential of the phase we are discussing. If the charge distribution throughout the system holds constant, the phase potential will remain constant, but alterations in charge distributions inside or outside the phase will change the phase potential. Thus, we have our first indication that differences in potential arising from chemical interactions between phases have some sort of charge separation as their basis.

An interesting question concerns the location of any excess charge on a conducting phase. The ==Gauss law== from elementary electrostatics (24) is extremely helpful here. It says that if we enclose a volume with an imaginary surface (a Gaussian surface), we will find that the net charge, $q$, inside the surface is given by an integral of the electric field over the surface:

> [!equation]
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> q=\varepsilon_{0} \oint \boldsymbol{\mathcal { E }} \cdot d \mathbf{S} \tag{2.2.3}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 

where $\varepsilon_{0}$ is a proportionality constant, ${ }^{16}$ and $d \mathbf{S}$ is an infinitesimal vector normal outward from the surface. Now consider a Gaussian surface located within a conductor that is uniform in its interior (i.e., without voids or interior phases). If no current flows, $\mathcal{E}$ is zero at all points on the Gaussian surface; hence, the net charge within the boundary is zero. The situation is depicted in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.2.1</span>. This conclusion applies to any Gaussian surface, even one situated just inside the phase boundary; thus, we must infer that any excess charge resides on the surface of the conducting phase. ${ }^{17}$

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.2.1</span> Cross-section of a three-dimensional conducting phase containing a Gaussian enclosure. Illustration that the excess charge resides on the surface of the phase.

[^11]A view of the way in which phase potentials are established is now beginning to emerge:

1) The potential of a conducting phase can be changed by altering charge distributions on or around the phase.
2) If the phase undergoes a change in its excess charge, its charge carriers adjust such that the excess becomes wholly distributed over the entire boundary of the phase.
3) The surface distribution is such that the electric field strength within the phase is zero under null-current conditions.
4) The interior of the phase features a constant potential, $\phi$.

The excess charge needed to change the inner potential of a conductor to an electrochemically significant degree is sometimes not very large. Consider, for example, a spherical mercury drop of 0.5 mm radius. Changing its potential requires only about $5 \times 10^{-14} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{V}$ (about 300,000 electrons/V), if it is suspended in air or in a vacuum (23).

## 2.2.2 Interactions Between Conducting Phases


> [!questions] questions
> Contents


When two conductors, e.g., a metal and an electrolyte, are placed in contact, the situation becomes complicated by the coulombic interaction between the phases. Charging one phase to change its inner potential tends to alter the inner potential of the neighboring phase as well. This point is illustrated in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.2.2</span>, which portrays a situation where there is a charged metal sphere of macroscopic size, perhaps a mercury droplet 0.5 mm in radius, surrounded by a layer of uncharged electrolyte a few millimeters in thickness. This assembly is suspended in a vacuum. We know that the charge on the metal, $q^{\mathrm{M}}$, resides on its surface. This unbalanced charge (negative in the diagram) attracts an excess cation concentration near the electrode in the solution. What can we say about the magnitudes and distributions of the obvious charge imbalances in solution?



> [!questions] questions
> Contents



Consider the integral in (2.2.3) over the Gaussian surface shown in <span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.2.2</span>. Since this surface is in a conducting phase where current is not flowing, $\mathcal{E}$ at every point is zero and the net enclosed charge is also zero. We could place the Gaussian surface just outside the boundary between the metal and solution, and we would reach the same conclusion. Thus, we know now that the excess positive charge in the solution, $q^{\mathrm{S}}$, resides at the metal/solution interface and [^12]exactly compensates the excess metal charge. That is,
$$
\begin{equation*}
q^{\mathrm{S}}=-q^{\mathrm{M}} \tag{2.2.4}
\end{equation*}
$$
[New symbols define here; make sure they are defined in the symbol index.]

This fact is very useful in the treatment of interfacial charge arrays, which we have already seen as electrical double layers (Section 1.6 and Chapter 14). ${ }^{18}$

Alternatively, we might move the Gaussian surface to a location just inside the outer boundary of the electrolyte. The enclosed charge must still be zero; yet we know that the net charge on the whole system is $q^{\mathrm{M}}$. A negative charge equal to $q^{\mathrm{M}}$ must, therefore, reside at the outer surface of the electrolyte.

[New symbols define here; make sure they are defined in the symbol index.]

<span style="color:#ffc000; font-weight:bold">Figure 2.2.3</span> is a display of electric potential vs. distance from the center of this assembly, i.e., the work done to bring a unit positive test charge from infinitely far away to a given distance from the center. As the test charge is brought from the right side of the diagram, it is attracted by the charge on the outer surface of the electrolyte; thus, negative work is required to traverse any distance toward the electrolyte surface in the surrounding vacuum, and the electric potential steadily drops in that direction. Within the electrolyte, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal { E }}$ is zero everywhere, so there is no work in moving the test charge, and the potential is constant at $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$. At the metal/solution interface, there is a strong field because of the double layer there, and it is oriented such that negative work is done in taking the positive test charge through the interface. Thus, there is a sharp change in potential from $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ to $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$ over the distance scale of the double layer. ${ }^{19}$ Since the metal is a field-free volume, the electric potential is constant in its interior. If we were to increase the negative charge on the metal, we would naturally lower $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$, but we would also lower $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$, because the excess negative charge on the outer boundary of the solution would increase, and the test charge would be attracted more strongly to the electrolyte layer at every point on the path through the vacuum.



> [!questions] Questions

The difference $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$, called the ==interfacial potential difference==, depends on the charge imbalance at the interface and the physical size of the interface. That is, it depends on the charge density ( $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ) at the interface. Making a change in this interfacial potential difference requires sizable alterations in charge density. For the spherical mercury drop considered above ( $A=0.03 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ ), now surrounded by 0.1 M strong electrolyte, one would need about $10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$ (or $6 \times 10^{12}$ electrons) for a $1-\mathrm{V}$ change. These numbers are more than $10^{7}$ times larger than for the case where the electrolyte is absent. The difference appears because the coulombic field of any surface charge is counterbalanced to a very large degree by polarization of the adjacent electrolyte.

> [!aside] 18
> Here we are considering the problem on a macroscopic distance scale, and it is accurate to think of $q^{\mathrm{S}}$ as residing at the metal-solution interface. On a scale of $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or finer, the picture is more detailed. One finds that $q^{\mathrm{S}}$ is still near the metal-solution interface, but is distributed in one or more zones that can be thicker than 100 nm (Section 14.3). 19 The diagram is drawn on a macroscopic scale, so the transition from $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ to $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$ appears vertical. The theory of the double layer (Section 14.3) indicates that most of the change occurs over a distance equivalent to one to several solvent monolayers, with a smaller portion being manifested over the diffuse layer in solution.




In practical electrochemistry, metallic electrodes are partially exposed to an electrolyte and partially insulated. For example, one might use a $0.1-\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ platinum disk electrode attached to a platinum lead that is almost fully sealed in glass. It is interesting to consider the location of excess charge used in altering the inner potential of such a phase. Of course, the charge must be distributed over the entire surface, including both the insulated and the electrochemically active areas. However, we have seen that the coulombic interaction with the electrolyte is so strong that essentially all of the charge at any value of potential will lie adjacent to the solution, unless the percentage of the metal area in contact with electrolyte is really minuscule. ${ }^{20}$

Practical means exist for placing an excess charge on a phase. An important one is simply to pump electrons into or out of a metal or a semiconductor with a power supply. Indeed, we will make great use of this approach to control the kinetics of electrode processes.



> [!questions] Questions

There are also chemical mechanisms for charging a phase. For example, we know from experience that a platinum wire dipped into a solution containing ferricyanide and ferrocyanide will have its potential shift toward a predictable equilibrium value given by the Nernst equation. This process occurs because the electron affinities of the two phases initially differ; hence, there is a transfer of electrons from the metal to the solution or vice versa [Section 2.2.5(d)]. Ferricyanide is reduced, or ferrocyanide is oxidized. The transfer of charge continues until the electrode potential reaches the equilibrium point, where the electron affinities of the solution and the metal are equal. Compared to the total charge that could be transferred to or from ferri- and ferrocyanide in a typical system, only a tiny charge is needed to establish the equilibrium at Pt; consequently, the net chemical effects on the solution are unnoticeable. By this mechanism, the metal adapts to the solution and reflects its composition.

Electrochemistry is full of situations like this one, in which charged species (electrons or ions) cross interfacial boundaries. These processes create a net transfer of charge that sets up the potential differences that we observe. Considering them in more detail must, however, await the development of additional concepts (Section 2.3 and Chapter 3).

Actually, interfacial potential differences can develop without an excess charge on either phase. Consider an aqueous electrolyte in contact with an electrode. Since the electrolyte interacts with the metal surface (e.g., wetting it), the water dipoles in contact with the metal generally have some preferential orientation. From a coulombic standpoint, this situation is equivalent to charge separation across the interface, because the dipoles are not randomized with time. Moving a test charge through the interface requires work; therefore, the interfacial potential difference is not zero (25-28).

## 2.2.3 Measurement of Potential Differences

The interfacial potential difference, $\Delta \phi$, between two phases in contact is of primary importance to electrochemical processes occurring at their interface. Its influence is partly based on the interfacial electric field, which embodies the high rate of change in $\phi$ at the boundary. This field can reach a strength as high as $10^{7} \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm}$. It can be large enough to distort electroreactants and alter their reactivity, and it can affect the dynamics of charge transport across the boundary.

[^13]Figure 2.2.4 Two devices for measuring the potential of a cell containing the $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ interface.

![[Pasted image 20260222092314.png]]

However, a more important aspect for electrochemistry is the direct influence of the potential difference on the relative energies of electrons on either side of the interface. It controls the relative electron affinities of the two phases; hence, it controls the rate, and even the direction, of any electrochemical reaction at the interface.

Unfortunately, $\Delta \phi$ is not measurable for a single interface, because one cannot sample the electrical properties of the system without introducing at least one more interface. This is true because devices for measuring potential differences (e.g., high-impedance voltmeters or electrometers) can be calibrated only to register potential differences between two phases of the same composition.



Consider $\Delta \phi$ at the interface $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Shown in Figure 2.2.4a is the simplest approach that one could make to obtain $\Delta \phi$ using a potentiometric instrument with copper contacts. The measurable potential difference between the copper phases clearly includes-in addition to $\Delta \phi$-interfacial potential differences at the $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Cu}$ interface and the $\mathrm{Cu} /$ electrolyte interface. We might simplify matters by constructing a voltmeter wholly from zinc, but, as shown in Figure 2.2.4b, the measurable voltage would still contain contributions from two separate interfacial potential differences.

By now we realize that a measured cell potential is a sum of several interfacial differences, none of which we can evaluate independently. For example, one can sketch the "stairstep" potential profile through the cell

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime} \tag{2.2.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

according to Vetter's representation (26) in the manner of Figure 1.1.2, where we see the measurable equilibrium potential difference, $E$, defined as $\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}$.

Even with these complications, it is still possible to focus on a single interfacial potential difference, such as that between zinc and the electrolyte in (2.2.5). If we can maintain constant interfacial potentials at all other junctions in the cell, then any change in the measurable quantity, $E$, must be wholly attributed to a change in $\Delta \phi$ at the zinc/electrolyte boundary. Keeping the other junctions at a constant potential difference is not so difficult, for the metal/metal junctions always remain constant (at constant temperature), and the silver/electrolyte junction is fixed if the activities of the participants in its half-reaction remain fixed. When this idea is understood, the rationale behind half-cell potentials and the choice of reference electrodes becomes much clearer.

## 2.2.4 Electrochemical Potentials

Let us continue to consider the interface $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(aqueous), while focusing on zinc ions in metallic zinc and in solution. In the metal, $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ is fixed in a crystalline array, with mobile electrons permeating the structure. In solution, zinc ion is hydrated and may interact with $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The energy state of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ clearly depends on the local chemical environment, which manifests itself through short-range forces that are mostly electrical. In addition, there is the energy required simply to bring the +2 charge, disregarding the chemical effects, to the location in question. This second energy is proportional to the local electric potential, $\phi$; hence, it depends on the electrical properties of an environment very much larger than the ion itself. Although one cannot experimentally separate these two components for a single species, the differences in the
distance scales of the two environments make it plausible to separate the energy components mathematically (25-28). Butler (29) and Guggenheim (30) developed the conceptual separation and introduced the electrochemical potential, $\bar{\mu}_{j}$, for species $j$ with charge $z_{j}$ at a given physical location, $(x, y, z)$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{j}(x, y, z)=\mu_{j}(x, y, z)+z_{j} F \phi(x, y, z) \tag{2.2.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

In (2.2.6), $\mu_{j}$ is the familiar chemical potential,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{j}=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial n_{j}}\right)_{T, P, n_{\mathrm{k} \neq j}} \tag{2.2.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $n_{j}$ is the number of moles of $j$ in the local volume element. Analogously, the electrochemical potential would be

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{j}=\left(\frac{\partial \bar{G}}{\partial n_{j}}\right)_{T, P, n_{\mathrm{k} \neq j}} \tag{2.2.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

in which the electrochemical free energy, $\bar{G}$, differs from the chemical free energy, $G$, by the inclusion of effects from the large-scale electrical environment.

If species $j$ is in a homogeneous conducting phase, $\alpha$, at equilibrium, then $\bar{\mu}_{j}, \mu_{j}$, and $\phi$ do not vary over all interior points, and $\phi$ is the inner potential, $\phi^{\alpha}$. In that situation, (2.2.6) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{j}^{\alpha}=\mu_{j}^{\alpha}+z_{j} F \phi^{\alpha} \tag{2.2.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

which applies to the whole phase, not just to a particular location.

### (a) Properties of the Electrochemical Potential

Important relationships involving electrochemical potentials include the following:

1) For an uncharged species at any location: $\bar{\mu}_{j}=\mu_{j}$.
2) For any substance at any location: $\mu_{j}=\mu_{j}^{0}+R T \ln a_{j}$, where $\mu_{j}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, and $a_{j}$ is the local activity of species $j$.
3) For a pure phase, $\alpha$, at equilibrium and at unit activity (e.g., solid $\mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{AgCl}, \mathrm{Ag}$, or $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ): $\bar{\mu}_{j}^{\alpha}=\mu_{j}^{0 \alpha}$.
4) For electrons ( $z=-1$ ) in a metal phase, $\alpha: \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\alpha}=\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \alpha}-\mathrm{F} \phi^{\alpha}$. There is no separate activity term because the electron concentration never changes appreciably.
5) For equilibrium of species $j$ between phases $\alpha$ and $\beta: \bar{\mu}_{j}^{\alpha}=\bar{\mu}_{j}^{\beta}$.

### (b) Reactions in a Single Phase

Within a single conducting phase, $\alpha$, the inner potential exerts no effect on a chemical equilibrium. The $\phi^{\alpha}$-terms drop out of relations involving electrochemical potentials, and only chemical potentials remain. To see this effect, consider the acid-base equilibrium:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{HOAc} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OAc}^{-} \tag{2.2.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

which requires that

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{HOAc}} & =\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{OAc}^{-}}  \tag{2.2.11}\\
\mu_{\mathrm{HOAc}} & =\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}+F \phi^{\alpha}+\mu_{\mathrm{OAc}^{-}}-F \phi^{\alpha}  \tag{2.2.12}\\
\mu_{\mathrm{HOAc}} & =\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}+\mu_{\mathrm{OAc}^{-}} \tag{2.2.13}
\end{align*}
$$

### (c) Reactions Involving Two Phases Without Charge Transfer

Let us now examine the solubility equilibrium

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{AgCl}(\text { crystal }) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \quad(\text { solution }, \mathrm{S}) \tag{2.2.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

for which we can write

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{0 \mathrm{AgCl}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}} \tag{2.2.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

Expanding, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{0 \mathrm{AgCl}}=\mu_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+F \phi^{\mathrm{S}}+\mu_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{OS}}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}-F \phi^{\mathrm{S}} \tag{2.2.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

and rearrangement gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{0 \mathrm{AgCl}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}^{\mathrm{OS}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{OS}}=R T \ln \left(a_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}^{\mathrm{S}} a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}\right)=R T \ln K_{\mathrm{sp}} \tag{2.2.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ is the solubility product.
The $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$-terms canceled in (2.2.16). Since the final result depends only on chemical potentials, the equilibrium is unaffected by the potential difference across the interface. This is a general feature of interphase reactions without transfer of charge (either ionic or electronic).

### (d) Equilibrium Between Two Metals

Consider the connection of a Cu wire to a Zn electrode. At equilibrium,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Zn}}  \tag{2.2.18}\\
& \mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{Cu}}-F \phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}=\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{Zn}}-F \phi^{\mathrm{Zn}} \tag{2.2.19}
\end{align*}
$$

Rearranging, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi^{\mathrm{Zn}}-\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}=\left(\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{Zn}}-\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{Cu}}\right) / F \tag{2.2.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

which indicates that an electric potential difference, $\phi^{\mathrm{Zn}}-\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}$, is established between the Zn and Cu at equilibrium. This potential difference, called a contact potential, is proportional to the difference in standard chemical potentials of electrons in the two metals. ${ }^{21}$ The equilibrium is established by the transfer of electrons immediately upon contact between the metals.

As established in Section 2.2.3, one cannot measure a potential difference at a single interface with thermodynamic rigor; however, means exist for estimating the values of contact potentials.

Figure 1.1.2, showing the potential distribution across an entire electrochemical cell, includes contact potentials at $\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Zn}$ and $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Cu}$ interfaces.

### (e) Formulation of a Cell Potential

When net charge transfer occurs across an interface, the $\phi$-terms do not cancel and the interfacial potential difference strongly affects the chemical process. One can use that potential difference either to probe or to alter the equilibrium position. As an example, consider cell (2.2.5), for which the cell reaction can be written

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{AgCl}+2 e\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}\right) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+2 e(\mathrm{Cu}) \tag{2.2.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

At equilibrium,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\mathrm{Zn}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{\mathrm{AgCl}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Ag}}^{\mathrm{Ag}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}}  \tag{2.2.22}\\
& 2\left(\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}}\right)=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Ag}}^{\mathrm{Ag}}+2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\mathrm{Zn}}-2 \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{\mathrm{AgCl}} \tag{2.2.23}
\end{align*}
$$

[^14]But,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2\left(\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Cu}}\right)=-2 F\left(\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}\right)=-2 F E \tag{2.2.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

Expanding (2.2.23), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
-2 F E= & \mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+2 F \phi^{\mathrm{S}}+2 \mu_{\mathrm{Ag}}^{0 \mathrm{Ag}}+2 \mu_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}} \\
& +2 R T \ln a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}-2 F \phi^{\mathrm{S}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{0 \mathrm{Zn}}-2 \mu_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{0 \mathrm{AgCl}}  \tag{2.2.25}\\
-2 F E= & \Delta G^{0}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}\left(a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}\right)^{2} \tag{2.2.26}
\end{align*}
$$

where

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G^{0}=\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}+2 \mu_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}+2 \mu_{\mathrm{Ag}}^{0 \mathrm{Ag}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{0 \mathrm{Zn}}-2 \mu_{\mathrm{AgCl}}^{0 \mathrm{AgCl}}=-2 F E^{0} \tag{2.2.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we arrive at

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0}-\frac{R T}{2 F} \ln \left(a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}\right)\left(a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\mathrm{S}}\right)^{2} \tag{2.2.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the Nernst equation for the cell. This corroboration of an earlier result displays the general utility of electrochemical potentials for treating interfacial reactions with charge transfer. They are powerful tools.

They are easily used, for instance, to consider whether the two cells

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}  \tag{2.2.29}\\
& \mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Au} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime} \tag{2.2.30}
\end{align*}
$$

would have the same cell potential. This point is left to the reader as Problem 2.8.

## 2.2.5 Fermi Energy and Absolute Potential

### (a) The Absolute Scale

For most purposes in electrochemistry, it is sufficient to refer electrode potentials and half-cell emfs arbitrarily to the NHE, but it is sometimes helpful to have an estimate of the absolute potential or single electrode potential.

The idea of the absolute scale is to define a redox couple at equilibrium in terms of a half-reaction in which the electrons are in vacuo, rather than being on a metal electrode. The most important case is

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 e_{\mathrm{vac}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \tag{2.2.31}
\end{equation*}

which relates to the NHE. If we can determine the change in standard free energy for (2.2.31), $\Delta G_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$, then we also have the corresponding standard potential, $E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}=-\Delta G_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}} / n F$, which is "absolute" in the sense that it is defined from first principles, independent of any reference electrode. The reason for the independence is that the electric potential for electrons in vacuo, ( $e_{\mathrm{vac}}$ ), is a defined value, $\phi^{\mathrm{vac}}=0$. In the normal $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$ half-reaction,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 e_{\mathrm{M}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \tag{2.2.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

the electrons are on an electrode having an unknowable electric potential, $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$, which can be handled only by reference to a second electrode.

A good deal of effort has been devoted to the absolute potential of the NHE ( $10,31-36$ ), which has been estimated as $E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}=4.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~V}$. This result is built on both theory and experimental results, but is not reached with thermodynamic rigor. By accepting this estimate for $E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$, one can place any other couple, $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$, on the absolute scale. Its position is $E_{\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}=E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}+ E_{\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}}^{0}$ (vs.NHE). Figure 2.1.2 illustrates the principle.

### (b) Equivalence of Fermi Level and Electrochemical Potential of Electrons

If we subtract (2.2.32) from (2.2.31), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 e_{\mathrm{vac}} \rightleftharpoons 2 e_{\mathrm{M}} \tag{2.2.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

Per mole of electrons, the free energy change for this process is $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\text {vac }}$; however, by definition, $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{vac}}=0$. Per electron, the free energy change becomes $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}} / N_{\mathrm{A}}$, which must be the same as the average energy level occupied in the metal upon addition and equilibration of an electron from vacuum (or the average energy level vacated by loss of an electron into vacuum). This energy of "transferable" electrons is known as the Fermi energy, $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}} .22$

The process that we used to reach this conclusion for the NHE is broadly applicable. For any phase $\alpha$ at equilibrium,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\alpha}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\alpha} / N_{\mathrm{A}} \tag{2.2.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

The Fermi energy is an equivalent representation of the electrochemical potential of electrons in a phase. Consequently, $-\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ is the energy needed to remove a single electron from the metal into vacuum, producing an equilibrated vacancy. Removal of an electron from $\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(a=1)$ to vacuum requires about 4.4 eV , or $425 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$.

### (c) Relationship between Absolute Potential and Fermi Level

One can re-express the free energy change for (2.2.33) in terms of the absolute potential by recognizing $\Delta G_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}=-2 F E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$ for (2.2.31) and $\Delta G^{0}=0$, by definition, for (2.2.32). The difference between these two, $-2 F E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$, is the free energy change for (2.2.33). Division by $2 N_{\mathrm{A}}$ gives the free energy change per electron as $-e E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$, which is also the Fermi energy for the NHE. If both values are expressed in $\mathrm{eV}, \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ for an NHE at equilibrium is numerically the same as $-E_{\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}}^{0 \mathrm{a}}$. In fact, this relationship applies to any half-cell at equilibrium, as one can see in Figure 2.1.2. ${ }^{23}$

### (d) Equilibrium in a Half-Cell

For an inert metal in contact with a solution, the condition for electrical (or electronic) equilibrium is that the Fermi energies of the two phases be equal:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{S}}=\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}} \tag{2.2.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

This condition is equivalent to saying that the electrochemical potentials of electrons in both phases are equal, or that the average energies of transferable electrons are the same in both phases (31).

Unlike a metal, the solution phase has no "free electrons." Electrons transferable to the electrode are localized on the reduced half of a redox couple (e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ). However, the fact that these electrons are bound to a specific chemical species does not preclude a rigorously defined Fermi energy for the solution (31).

When a metal is brought into contact with a solution containing $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, for example, the Fermi energies of metal and solution will not usually be equal. Equality is attained by the transfer of electrons between the phases, with electrons flowing from the phase with the higher

[^15]Fermi energy (higher $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}$ or more energetic electrons) to the phase with the lower Fermi energy. This electron flow adjusts the interfacial charge and causes the potential difference between the phases (and the electrode potential) to shift. As equilibrium is established, the electrode potential stabilizes. The total amount of charge transferred in this process is normally quite small (Section 2.2.2) and does not significantly change the composition of the cell.

Equilibrium in this example requires

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}} \tag{2.2.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

With rearrangement of (2.3.36) and expansion of the electrochemical potentials, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}-R T \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}}{a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}}-F \phi^{\mathrm{S}} \tag{2.2.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

showing that $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ (i.e., the Fermi energy of the metal) does indeed reflect the standard chemical potentials and activities of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$.

We can rewrite (2.2.37) in terms of the measurable electrode potential ( $E$ vs. a reference electrode) and the standard potential of the redox couple, $E_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{0}$. To do so, we employ three definitions previously established in this chapter:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{M}}-F \phi^{\mathrm{M}}  \tag{2.2.38}\\
& E=\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}  \tag{2.2.39}\\
& E_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{0} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}=-\left(\mu_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{0 \mathrm{~S}}\right) / F \tag{2.2.40}
\end{align*}
$$

Substitution of all three into (2.2.37), with subsequent rearrangement, yields,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{0}+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}}{a_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}}+\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{M}}}{F}-\left(\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}\right) \tag{2.2.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{M}}$ is the standard chemical potential of the electron in the metal, and $\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ is the electric potential difference between the reference electrode and the solution. Equation 2.2.41 confirms that $E$, like $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}}$, depends on the activities of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$.

In (2.2.38), each term has units of energy per mole. Division by the Avogadro constant, $N_{\mathrm{A}}$, allows us to express each in terms of energy per electron. In the process, we recognize (a) that $F / N_{\mathrm{A}}=e$ (where $e$ is the electronic charge), (b) that $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}=E+\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}$, (c) that $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{M}} / N_{\mathrm{A}}=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$, and (d) that $\mu_{\mathrm{e}}^{0 \mathrm{M}} / N_{\mathrm{A}}=-\Phi_{\mathrm{M}}$ (where $\Phi_{\mathrm{M}}$ is the work function of the electrode material)(37). ${ }^{24}$ Thus, (2.2.38) is equivalent to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}=-\Phi_{\mathrm{M}}-e\left(E+\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}\right) \tag{2.2.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Three important points can be drawn from this relationship:

- The value of $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ reflects both the electronic structure of the metal, as quantified by the work function, and the state of charge on phases in the cell, including the metal, as given by the last term in (2.2.42).
- The relationship between $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ and any measurable $E$ cannot be rigorously evaluated because $\phi^{\mathrm{ref}}$, the potential of a single electrode, is unknowable.

[^16]- As $E$ is shifted toward more positive values, the electron energy in the metal, $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$, decreases by a corresponding magnitude (and vice versa). This difference in directionality of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{M}}$ and $E$ is shown in Figure 2.1.2.
