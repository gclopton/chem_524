# 2.4 Ion-Selective Electrodes

## 2.4.1 Selective Interfaces

Suppose one could create an interface between two electrolyte phases across which only a single ion could penetrate. Equation 2.3.36 would still apply at the selective interface; but it would be
simplified by recognizing that the transference number for the permeating ion is unity, while that for every other ion is zero. If both electrolytes are in a common solvent, one obtains by integration of (2.3.36),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{R T}{z_{j}} \ln \frac{a_{j}^{\beta}}{a_{j}^{\alpha}}+F\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}\right)=0 \tag{2.4.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where ion $j$ is the permeating species. Rearrangement gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}=-\frac{R T}{z_{j} F} \ln \frac{a_{j}^{\beta}}{a_{j}^{\alpha}} \tag{2.4.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $E_{\mathrm{m}}=\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}$. If the activity of species $j$ is held constant in one phase, then $E_{\mathrm{m}}$, often called the membrane potential, responds in a Nernst-like fashion to the ion's activity in the other phase.

This idea is the essence of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) (59-65). Measurements with these devices are based on changes in membrane potentials. The performance of any such device is determined largely by the degree to which the species of interest can be made to dominate charge transport in part of the membrane. We will see below that real devices are fairly complicated and that selectivity in charge transport throughout the membrane is both rarely achieved and actually unnecessary.

A large variety of ion-selective interfaces have been studied, and many different types of electrodes are marketed commercially. We will examine the basic strategies for introducing selectivity by considering a few of them below. The glass membrane is our starting point, because it offers a good view of the fundamentals, as well as the usual complications found in practical devices.

## 2.4.2 Glass Electrodes

The ion-selective properties of glass/electrolyte interfaces were recognized early in the 20th century (66), and glass electrodes have been used since then for measurements of pH and the activities of alkali ions (16, 26, 47, 59-68). Figure 2.4.1 depicts the construction of a typical device. During measurements, the thin membrane is fully immersed in the test solution, and the potential of the electrode is registered with respect to a reference electrode, such as an SCE. Thus, the cell becomes,

$$
\underbrace{\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{KCl}(\text { sat'd }) /}_{\text {SCE }} \underbrace{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Test }  \tag{2.4.3}\\
\text { solution }
\end{array}}_{\text {Glass electrode }}
$$

The test solution influences the overall potential difference of the cell at both interfaces with other parts of the cell. From the considerations of Section 2.3.5, we can hope that the junction potential, $E_{j}$, between the SCE and the test solution is small. The more important influence of the test solution is on the potential difference across the glass membrane. If $E_{j}$ is negligible (or, at least, constant), and if all other interfaces in the cell feature phases of constant composition, changes in the cell potential can be wholly ascribed to the junction between the glass membrane and the test solution. If that interface is selective toward a single species, $j$, then the cell potential is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=\text { constant }+\frac{R T}{z_{j} F} \ln a_{j}^{\text {soln }} \tag{2.4.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the constant term includes the potential differences at all of the other interfaces. ${ }^{27}$ That term can be evaluated by "standardizing" the electrode, i.e., by measuring $E$ for a cell in which the test solution is a standard having a known activity for species $j .^{28,29}$

Actually, the operation of the glass phase is rather complicated (26,47,60,66,67). The bulk of the membrane, which might be about $50 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick, is dry glass through which charge transport occurs exclusively by the mobile cations present in the glass. Usually, these are alkali ions, such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$. Hydrogen ion from solution does not contribute to conduction in this region. The faces of the membrane differ from the bulk, in that the silicate structure of the glass is hydrated. As shown in Figure 2.4.2, the hydrated layers are thin. Interactions between the glass and an adjacent solution, which occur exclusively in a hydrated zone, are facilitated kinetically by swelling that accompanies the hydration.

Each hydrated zone gives rise to a membrane potential because the silicate network has an affinity for certain cations, which are probably adsorbed at fixed anionic sites. This action

Figure 2.4.3 Model for treating the membrane potential across a glass barrier.

creates a charge separation that alters the interfacial potential difference. That potential difference, in turn, alters the rates of adsorption and desorption. The rates are gradually brought into balance by a mechanism resembling the one responsible for the establishment of junction potentials, as discussed in Section 2.3.2.

Clearly, the glass membrane does not adhere to the simplified idea of a selectively permeable membrane. In fact, it may not be at all permeable to some of the ions of greatest interest, such as $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The transference number of such an ion cannot be unity throughout the membrane, and it may actually be zero in certain zones. Can we still understand the observed selective response? The answer is yes, provided that the ion of interest dominates charge transport in the interfacial regions of the membrane.

Let us consider a three-zone model for the glass membrane, as shown in Figure 2.4.3. In the interfacial zones, $\mathrm{m}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}$, equilibrium is rapidly attained with constituents in solution, so that each adsorbing species has an adsorbate activity reflecting its solute activity in the adjacent solution. In the bulk of the glass, denoted by $m$, we assume conduction by a single species, taken as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$for the sake of this argument. Thus, the whole system comprises five phases, and the overall difference in potential across the membrane is the sum of four contributions from the junctions between the phases:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}=\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}\right)+\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}}\right)+\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}\right)+\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\alpha}\right) \tag{2.4.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The first and last terms are interfacial potential differences arising from an equilibrium balance of selective charge exchange across an interface. This condition is known as Donnan equilibrium (26,60). The resulting potential difference can be evaluated from electrochemical potentials. Suppose we have $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as interfacially active ions. Then, at the $\alpha / m^{\prime}$ interface,

$$
\begin{align*}
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha} & =\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}  \tag{2.4.6}\\
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha} & =\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}} \tag{2.4.7}
\end{align*}
$$

Expanding (2.4.6), we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \alpha}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}+F \phi^{\alpha}=\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime}}+R T \ln a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}+F \phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}} \tag{2.4.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

and rearrangement gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\alpha}\right)=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \alpha}-\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime}}}{F}+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}} \tag{2.4.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

An equivalent treatment of the interface between $\beta$ and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}$ gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}\right)=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime \prime}}-\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \beta}}{F}+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}} \tag{2.4.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

Because both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are aqueous solutions, $\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \alpha}=\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \beta}$. Similarly, $\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime}}=\mu_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{0 \mathrm{~m}^{\prime \prime}}$. When we add (2.4.9) and (2.4.10) later in this development, these equivalencies will cause the terms involving $\mu^{0}$ to disappear.

The second and third components in (2.4.5) are junction potentials within the glass membrane. In the specialized literature, they are called diffusion potentials, because they arise from differential ionic diffusion in the manner discussed in Section 2.3.2. The systems correspond to Type 3 junctions as defined there.

We can treat them through a variant of the Henderson equation, (2.3.38). The usual form of this equation is derived from (2.3.36) by neglecting activity effects and assuming linear concentration profiles through the junction. Here, we are interested only in univalent positive charge carriers; hence, we can specialize (2.3.38) for the interface between m and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}\right)=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}+u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}}{u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}}} \tag{2.4.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

where activities have been used instead of concentrations. Likewise, for the interface between m and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(\phi^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}-\phi^{\mathrm{m}}\right)=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}}}{u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}+u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}} \tag{2.4.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now let us add the component potential differences, (2.4.9)-(2.4.12), as dictated by (2.4.5), to obtain the whole potential difference across the membrane: ${ }^{30}$

$$
\begin{align*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}= & \frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta} a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}} \quad(\text { Donnan term }) \\
& +\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right) a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}}{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right) a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}} \quad(\text { Diffusion term }) \tag{2.4.13}
\end{align*}
$$

Some important simplifications can be made in this result. First, we combine the two terms in (2.4.13) and rearrange to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right)\left(a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}} / a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}\right)+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}}{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right)\left(a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}} / a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}}\right)+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}} \tag{2.4.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now consider (2.4.6) and (2.4.7), which apply simultaneously. Their sum must also be true:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}} \tag{2.4.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is a free energy balance for the ion-exchange reaction:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\alpha)+\mathrm{H}^{+}\left(m^{\prime}\right) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(\alpha)+\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(m^{\prime}\right) \tag{2.4.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^21]Since it does not involve net charge transfer, it is not sensitive to the interfacial potential difference [Section 2.2.4(c)], and it has an equilibrium constant given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}=\frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\mathrm{m}^{\prime}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}} \tag{2.4.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

An equivalent expression, involving the same numeric value of $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}$, would apply to the interface between phases $\beta$ and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}$. These relations can be substituted into (2.4.14) to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right) K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}}{\left(u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}\right) K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\beta}+a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}} \tag{2.4.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}$and $u_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}} / u_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$are constants of the experiment, it is convenient to define their product as a potentiometric selectivity coefficient, $k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{pot}}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}+k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{pot}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}+k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{pot}} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\beta}} \tag{2.4.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the $\beta$ phase is the internal filling solution (of constant composition) and the $\alpha$ phase is the test solution, then the overall potential of the cell is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=\text { constant }+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}+k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\text {pot }} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}\right) \tag{2.4.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

This expression tells us that the cell potential is responsive to the activities of both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the test solution, and that the degree of selectivity between these species is defined by $k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\text {pot }}$. If the product $k_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\text {pot }} a_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\alpha}$ is much less than $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}$, then the membrane responds essentially exclusively to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. When that condition applies, charge exchange between the phases $\alpha$ and $\mathrm{m}^{\prime}$ is dominated by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

We have formulated this problem to include only $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as active species. Glass membranes also respond to other ions, such as $\mathrm{Li}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. The relative responses can be expressed through the corresponding potentiometric selectivity coefficients (see Problem 2.16 for some typical numbers), which are influenced to a great extent by the composition of the glass. Different types of electrodes, based on different glasses, are marketed. They are broadly classified as (a) $p H$ electrodes with a selectivity order $\mathrm{H}^{+} \ggg \mathrm{Na}^{+}>\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Rb}^{+}, \mathrm{Cs}^{+} \gg \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, (b) sodium-sensitive electrodes with the order $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}>\mathrm{H}^{+}>\mathrm{Na}^{+} \gg \mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Li}^{+} \gg \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and (c) a more general cation-sensitive electrode with a narrower selectivity range in the order $\mathrm{H}^{+}>\mathrm{K}^{+}>\mathrm{Na}^{+}>\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}, \mathrm{Li}^{+} \gg \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

There is a large literature on the design, performance, and theory of glass electrodes (16, 26, 47, 59-68). The interested reader is referred to it for more advanced discussions.

## 2.4.3 Other Ion-Selective Electrodes

The principles that we have just reviewed also apply to other types of selective membranes (59-65, 68, 69). The most common types fall into two categories.

### (a) Solid-State Membranes

Like the glass membrane, which is a member of this group, the remaining common solidstate membranes are electrolytes having tendencies toward the preferential adsorption of certain ions.

Consider, for example, the single-crystal $\mathrm{LaF}_{3}$ membrane, which is doped with $\mathrm{EuF}_{2}$ to create fluoride vacancies that allow ionic conduction by fluoride. Its surface selectively accommodates $\mathrm{F}^{-}$to the virtual exclusion of other species, except $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$.

Other membranes are made from precipitates of insoluble salts, such as $\mathrm{AgCl}, \mathrm{AgBr}, \mathrm{AgI}$, $\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S}, \mathrm{CuS}, \mathrm{CdS}$, and PbS , usually pressed into pellets. The silver salts all conduct by mobile $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions, but the heavy metal sulfides are usually mixed with $\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$, since they are not very conductive. The surfaces of these membranes are generally sensitive to the ions comprising the salts, as well as to other species that tend to form very insoluble precipitates with a constituent ion. For example, the $\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ membrane responds to $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \mathrm{S}^{2-}$, and $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$. Likewise, the AgCl membrane is sensitive to $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}, \mathrm{I}^{-}, \mathrm{CN}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$.

### (b) Plastic Membranes

An alternative approach involves a hydrophobic polymer membrane (usually called a plastic membrane in the commercial literature) as the sensing element. As shown in Figure 2.4.4, the membrane separates an aqueous internal filling solution from an aqueous test solution. A chelating agent with selectivity toward an ion of interest is dissolved in the polymer, and it provides the mechanism for selective charge transport across the boundaries of the membrane.

A device based on these principles is a calcium-selective electrode. The polymer is typically poly(vinylchloride) (PVC), and the chelating agent might be the sodium salt of an alkyl phosphate ester, $(\mathrm{RO})_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{2}^{-} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, where R is an aliphatic chain having $8-18$ carbons. The membrane is sensitive to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, as well as to interfering ions (Table 2.4.1). "Water hardness" electrodes are based on similar agents, but are designed to show virtually equal responses to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.

ISEs featuring polymer membranes are also available for anions, including $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}, \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Nitrate and perchlorate can be sensed by membranes based on chelating agents like alkylated 1,10-phenanthroline complexes of $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$. All three ions are active at other membranes based on quaternary ammonium salts.

Most polymer-membrane ISEs feature charged chelating agents, and their operation is based on ion-exchange equilibria. A different type of device involves an uncharged chelating agent, called a neutral carrier, which enables the transport of charge by selectively complexing certain ions. For example, potassium-selective electrodes can be constructed with the natural macrocycle valinomycin as a neutral carrier. This membrane has a much higher sensitivity to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$than

[^22]to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Li}^{+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$; but $\mathrm{Rb}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$are sensed to much the same degree as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The selectivity rests on the recognition of the target ion in the complexing site of the carrier.

### (c) Commercial Devices

Table 2.4.1 is a listing of typical commercial ion-selective electrodes, together with the pH and concentration ranges over which they operate and typical interferences. Selectivity coefficients for many of these electrodes are available from reviews (68, 70-72) or the manufacturers' literature.

### (d) Detection Limits

As shown in Table 2.4.1, the lower limit for detection of an ion with an ISE is commonly $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$. This limit is often governed by the leaching of ions from the internal electrolyte into the zone of sample solution just outside the sensing surface $(64,73)$. The leakage can be prevented by using a lower concentration of the ion of interest in the internal electrolyte, so that the concentration gradient established in the membrane causes an ion flux from the sample to the inner electrolyte. This low concentration can be maintained with an ion buffer, that is, a mixture of the metal ion with an excess of a strong complexing agent. In addition, a high concentration of a second potential-determining ion is added to the internal solution. Under these conditions, the lower detection limit can be improved by orders of magnitude (64,74).

Commercial ISEs are generally constructed to operate with sample volumes of $10-250 \mathrm{~mL}$, although special products are marketed for operation in smaller volumes and in flow streams. The principles of operation remain the same, so we do not cover details of special products here.

Tiny, specially fabricated ISEs can be employed to determine local ion concentrations with high spatial resolution. This is an important practice in SECM and is addressed in Section 18.6.

### (e) Solid-Contact Ion-Selective Electrodes

All conventional ISEs feature ionic electrical contact on both sides of the selective membrane (with the test solution on the outer face, and with the electrolyte of the internal reference on the inner face). The two reference electrodes (internal and external) transduce the ionic membrane potential into an electronic potential difference measurable in the external circuit.

There is high interest in an alternative concept featuring "solid," rather than "liquid" contact (usually meaning electronic, rather than ionic, contact) between the inner electrode and the ion-selective membrane (64, 75, 76), as illustrated in Figure 2.4.5.

Solid contact is an idea with some important advantages. The internal reference electrode and filling solution would not be needed, so the overall structure of the ISE would be simplified, and possibilities would be enhanced for miniaturization, as well as for use in mobile environments. Moreover, ionic leakage from the internal filling solution into the test solution would be avoided, opening the possibility of an extended working range vs. conventional ISEs.

However, the conditions for success are formidable. To achieve practical stability, one must aspire to a system capable of responding essentially at equilibrium (as a conventional ISE does). Consequently, it must

1) Be able to equilibrate electrons between the inner electrode and the membrane.
2) Be able to equilibrate the target ion selectively between the test solution and at least an outer zone of the membrane.
3) Have enough electronic conductivity throughout the membrane to support electrical communication between the ion-exchange zone and the inner electrode.
These requirements suggest a need for a biconductive membrane (i.e., both electronically and ionically conducting). Hundreds of papers have been written about experimental devices based on varying ideas about the structure and composition of the membrane.

Figure 2.4.5 Concept of a solid-contact ISE. An inert inner electrode interfaces directly with the ion-selective membrane. This type of ISE would be paired with an external reference electrode to make a complete cell, just as in the case of a conventional ISE. However, there is no internal reference electrode within the ISE assembly.

Successes have been achieved with membranes based on electronically conducting polymers [e.g., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), polypyrrole, poly(3-octylthiophene), and polyaniline]. ${ }^{31}$ While these materials fulfill conditions 1 and 3 in the list above, they generally do not, by themselves, provide a basis for selective ion exchange with the test solution (condition 2). The ionic selectivity must be added through careful design. One might, for example, choose a charge-compensating ion for the conducting polymer that is also a neutral carrier for the ion of interest. Alternatively, one might modify the electronically conducting membrane to incorporate a lipophilic ion exchanger in a thin zone at the outer surface. Or one might even establish a distinct ion-exchanging polymer overlayer on the conducting polymer, much like a plastic membrane found in devices that we discussed above. In this last strategy, stability requires good ionic communication with the conducting polymer. That can sometimes be achieved using the ions employed for charge compensation in the conducting polymer. The original solid-contact design based on a conducting polymer was built on the last strategy (77).

[^23]Functional solid-contact membranes have also been created from carbon structures, including nanotubes and graphene, combined with ion-exchanging surfactants.

Successful systems have provided good stability, as well as working ranges comparable with those of conventional electrodes; however, no solid-contact ISE has yet become commercially available.

## 2.4.4 Gas-Sensing ISEs

Figure 2.4.6 depicts the structure of a typical potentiometric gas-sensing ISE (78). In general, such a device involves a glass pH electrode that is protected from the test solution by a polymer diaphragm. Between the glass membrane and the diaphragm is a small volume of electrolyte. Small molecules, such as $\mathrm{SO}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, can penetrate the membrane and interact with the trapped electrolyte by reactions that produce changes in pH . The glass electrode responds to the alterations in acidity.

Electrochemical cells that use a solid electrolyte composed of zirconium dioxide containing $\mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) are available to measure the oxygen content of gases at high temperature. Sensors of this type are widely used to monitor the exhaust gas from motor vehicles, so that the air-to-fuel mixture can be controlled to minimize the emission of pollutants such as CO and $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$. This solid electrolyte shows good conductivity only at high temperatures $\left(500-1,000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, where the conduction process is based on mobile oxide ions. A typical sensor is composed of a tube of zirconia with Pt electrodes deposited on the inside and outside of the tube. The outside electrode contacts air with a known partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{\mathrm{a}}$, and serves as the reference electrode. The inside of the tube is exposed to the hot exhaust gas with a lower oxygen partial pressure, $P_{\text {eg }}$. The cell configuration can, therefore, be written

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\text { air }, P_{\mathrm{a}}\right) / \mathrm{ZrO}_{2}+\mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} / \mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\text { exhaust gas, } P_{\mathrm{eg}}\right) / \mathrm{Pt} \tag{2.4.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

The potential of this oxygen concentration cell can be used to measure $P_{\text {eg }}$ (Problem 2.19).
The widely employed Clark oxygen electrode differs fundamentally from these devices(17,79). The Clark device is similar in construction to the apparatus of Figure 2.4.6, in that a polymer membrane traps an electrolyte against a sensing surface. However, the sensor is a platinum

electrode, and the analytical signal is the steady-state current due to the faradaic reduction of molecular oxygen. Amperometric sensors are discussed in Section 17.8.3.
