# Chapter 2 Glossary

## conducting phase

A **conducting phase** is a phase that contains mobile charge carriers (e.g., electrons in a metal or ions in an electrolyte) and therefore can support electrical conduction. In this chapter, when a conducting phase is at electrical equilibrium (no current flowing), the internal electric field vanishes and the phase is an equipotential volume with a well-defined inner potential.

## Debye-Hückel theory

**Debye-Hückel theory** is a theory of electrolyte nonideality that predicts ionic activity coefficients in dilute solutions of fully dissociated electrolytes. In this chapter it is used to connect the activity coefficient $\gamma_{j}$ to ionic strength, ion charge, and solvent/temperature-dependent parameters (e.g., Eq. (2.1.35)).

## electric potential

The **electric potential** $\phi(x,y,z)$ at a point is the electrostatic work per unit positive test charge required to bring that test charge from infinite distance to the point (with no material interactions), and it is path independent under electrostatic conditions. In this chapter, differences in $\phi$ across space and across interfaces underpin the discussion of phase potentials and interfacial potential differences.

## Electrochemically reversible

In this book, **electrochemically reversible** is shorthand for an **electrochemically reversible electrode process**. See **Nernstian electrode process**.

## Electrochemically reversible electrode process

See **Nernstian electrode process**.

## emf of the cell reaction

The **emf of the cell reaction** is a thermodynamic construct assigned to a written cell reaction (not to a particular physical cell). In this chapter it is defined by the cell-schematic convention (right electrode potential relative to left) and provides a directional quantity that is related to the Gibbs free energy change by $\Delta G=-n F E_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ (e.g., Eq. (2.1.25)).

## formal potential

The **formal potential** $E^{0^{\prime}}$ is the measured half-cell potential (vs. a specified reference scale) under defined solution conditions chosen so that the concentration-form reaction quotient for the oxidized and reduced forms is unity. In this chapter, the formal potential is used to absorb otherwise unknown activity-coefficient factors (and, when relevant, chemical-equilibrium effects of the medium) into a practical reference potential for Nernst-type calculations (e.g., Eq. (2.1.15) and Section 2.1.7).

## Galvani potential

See **inner potential**.

## Gauss law

**Gauss law** is the electrostatic relation that connects the net charge enclosed by a closed surface to the flux of the electric field through that surface (e.g., $q=\varepsilon_{0}\oint \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}}\cdot d\mathbf{S}$ in Eq. (2.2.3)). In this chapter it is used to argue about the location of excess charge in a conducting phase at electrical equilibrium.

## inner potential

The **inner potential** $\phi^{\alpha}$ of a phase $\alpha$ is the electric potential that applies throughout the interior of a conducting phase when it is at electrical equilibrium (no current flowing), so that the phase is an equipotential volume. In this chapter, “inner potential” is used as a phase property whose differences between phases define interfacial potential differences.

## interfacial potential difference

An **interfacial potential difference** is the difference in inner potential between two phases in contact, written in this chapter as a difference like $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$. In this chapter, the interfacial potential difference depends on interfacial charge density and on how that charge is screened or counterbalanced in the adjacent phases.

## mercuric oxide electrode

A **mercuric oxide electrode** is a reference electrode based on the equilibrium between Hg and HgO in an alkaline electrolyte. In this chapter it is presented as a reference-electrode option that is often preferable for strongly basic working solutions (Section 2.1.8).

## mercurous sulfate electrode

A **mercurous sulfate electrode** is a reference electrode based on the Hg/Hg$_2$SO$_4$ equilibrium in sulfate-containing electrolyte. In this chapter it is presented as a reference-electrode option used when chloride leakage from a chloride-based reference electrode is undesirable (Section 2.1.8).

## Nernstian

**Nernstian** describes behavior consistent with the Nernst relation: an electrode potential follows the equilibrium dependence on the activities (or, in some applications, concentrations) of the oxidized and reduced forms of a redox couple. In this chapter, the term is used primarily in connection with electrode reactions and electrode potentials, but the adjective itself is not limited in principle to a single object (it can describe any situation in which a Nernst-type equilibrium relationship is the governing model).

## Nernstian electrode process

An electrode process is **nernstian** if the electrode potential is governed by the Nernst relation for the corresponding redox couple (e.g., Eq. (2.1.15)), so that the measured potential reflects the equilibrium dependence on the activities (or, in some applications, concentrations) of oxidized and reduced species. In this chapter, “electrochemically reversible” and “thermodynamically reversible electrode process” are used as synonyms for this electrode-process meaning: the interfacial redox reaction maintains (or closely tracks) equilibrium on the time scale of the measurement. This is distinct from strict thermodynamic reversibility of an entire process.

## normal calomel electrode (NCE)

The **normal calomel electrode (NCE)** is a calomel reference electrode used in the literature, distinguished from the saturated calomel electrode by the concentration of chloride electrolyte used with the Hg/Hg$_2$Cl$_2$ couple. In this chapter it is treated as one of the practical reference electrodes with a tabulated potential on the hydrogen-electrode scale (Section 2.1.8).

## normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)

See **standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)**.

## Potential-pH diagrams

**Potential-pH diagrams** are plots of electrode potential (typically referenced to a chosen scale such as NHE/SHE) versus pH that summarize thermodynamic equilibria and predominance regions in aqueous systems. In this chapter, the lines in a potential-pH diagram are derived from Nernst relations under stated activity assumptions, and the diagram is used for thermodynamic predictions of stability and reactivity as pH and potential vary (Section 2.1.9).

## Pourbaix diagrams

See **Potential-pH diagrams**.

## predominance area

A **predominance area** is a region of a predominance area diagram (an $E$–pH diagram) in which a particular chemical species or phase is thermodynamically predominant under the stated assumptions (standard states, activity models, and chosen set of species). In this chapter, predominance areas are the labeled regions between boundary lines derived from equilibrium relations (typically Nernst-type expressions) and indicate which form is most stable at a given pH and electrode potential (Section 2.1.9).

## predominance area diagram

See **Potential-pH diagrams**.

## Practical reversibility

**Practical reversibility** describes a real (finite-rate) process that is not strictly thermodynamically reversible, but is carried out close enough to equilibrium that treating it as reversible is accurate to the tolerance required for the calculation or interpretation at hand. In electrochemical contexts, this typically means sufficiently small departures from equilibrium that thermodynamic relations can be applied without introducing significant error.

## quasireference electrodes (QRE)

**quasireference electrodes (QRE)** are reference electrodes used in practical measurements whose potentials are not fixed by a well-defined, reproducible equilibrium in the same way as a primary reference electrode. In this chapter they are introduced as common tools in nonaqueous electrochemistry, typically requiring calibration or internal referencing for quantitative work (e.g., Section 2.5.2).

## reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)

A **reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)** is a hydrogen reference electrode in which the hydrogen couple is equilibrated with the same aqueous solution used at the working electrode (the “test solution”), so that the electrode potential follows the Nernst dependence on $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ (and on hydrogen activity/pressure). In this chapter it is distinguished from the idealized NHE/SHE concept and is used as a practical pH-dependent reference (Section 2.1.8).

## Reversible path

A **reversible path** is an idealized path between two states of a system that passes through a continuum of equilibrium states. Because the system remains at equilibrium at every point along the path, an infinitesimal change in the driving force is sufficient to reverse the direction of the process at any moment. In practice, traversing a reversible path requires an infinitely slow (quasistatic) transformation.

## saturated calomel electrode (SCE)

The **saturated calomel electrode (SCE)** is a calomel reference electrode based on the Hg/Hg$_2$Cl$_2$ equilibrium in the presence of saturated KCl. In this chapter it is treated as a widely used practical reference electrode with a convenient, approximately fixed potential relative to the hydrogen-electrode scale (Section 2.1.8).

## standard free energies of formation

**standard free energies of formation** are standard thermodynamic quantities that give the Gibbs free energy change for forming a substance from its constituent elements in their standard states. In this chapter they are cited as examples of standard-state data and as inputs to standard thermodynamic calculations (Section 2.1.5).

## standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)

The **standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)** is the primary reference potential chosen by convention for electrochemical measurements. In this chapter it is described as an idealized standard: a hydrogen electrode under standard-state conditions for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, defining the reference scale (often treated as $0~\mathrm{V}$ by convention) for tabulated electrode potentials.

## standard potential of a cell or half-reaction

The **standard potential of a cell or half-reaction** is the electrode potential (or cell emf) defined when all participating species are in their standard states. In this chapter, standard potentials are denoted with a superscript $0$ and are the reference values in Nernst-type relations that describe how potentials shift with activities away from standard-state conditions (Section 2.1.5 and subsequent sections).

## standard state of a pure gas

The **standard state of a pure gas** is the gas at the standard pressure, treated as an ideal gas. In this chapter, this definition supplies the reference condition needed to define standard thermodynamic quantities and standard potentials.

## standard state of a pure solid

The **standard state of a pure solid** (or pure liquid) is the pure substance at the standard pressure (taken in this chapter as $10^{5}~\mathrm{Pa}$, i.e., $1~\mathrm{bar}$), with the allotrope or crystalline form specified when relevant. This definition supplies the reference condition needed to define standard thermodynamic quantities and standard potentials.

## standard state of a solute

The **standard state of a solute** is a hypothetical reference solution at a specified standard concentration under standard pressure that behaves as though the solute is at infinite dilution (so that ideal-solution behavior is recovered in the reference limit). In this chapter, this definition underlies the use of activities and activity coefficients in free-energy and Nernst-type relations.

## Standard thermodynamic quantities

**Standard thermodynamic quantities** are thermodynamic properties (or changes in thermodynamic state functions) defined for systems in which all relevant species are in their standard states. In this chapter, such quantities are denoted with a superscript $0$ (e.g., $\Delta G^{0}$) to distinguish them from values at nonstandard activities or concentrations.

## test solution

In this chapter, the **test solution** is the working solution whose composition (especially pH) is the subject of measurement or control at the working electrode and into which a reference electrode (such as an RHE) is placed. The test solution is the solution that sets $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ (and related variables) that appear in the reference-electrode potential.

## Thermodynamically reversible

A process is **thermodynamically reversible** if an infinitesimal reversal of the driving force causes the process to reverse direction. Equivalently, the process proceeds through states that are arbitrarily close to equilibrium at all times, so it can be reversed without leaving a finite “distance” from equilibrium; this is the ideal limit in which the thermodynamic relations for reversible transformations apply exactly and the attainable work is maximized.

## Thermodynamically reversible electrode process

See **Nernstian electrode process**.

## volume ionic strength

**volume ionic strength** is an ionic-strength measure defined in this chapter by $I=\tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{\mathrm{m}} z_{\mathrm{m}}^{2}C_{\mathrm{m}}$ (Eq. (2.1.36)), where the sum runs over ionic species and $C_{\mathrm{m}}$ are molar concentrations. In this chapter it is the concentration variable used in Debye–Hückel-type expressions for activity coefficients.

## well poised

A reference electrode is **well poised** if its potential is established by a rapid, reversible equilibrium between the electrode and both redox forms of a kinetically facile redox couple. In this chapter, well-poised reference electrodes are described as predictably stable and precise because the equilibrium composition at the electrode can respond quickly to small perturbations (Section 2.1.8).
