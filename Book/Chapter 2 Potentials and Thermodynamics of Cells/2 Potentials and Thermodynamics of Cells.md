In Chapter 1, we focused on potential as an electrochemical variable. Here we look more closely at the physical meaning of potential, the origins of potential differences, and access, through potential, to chemical information. Initially, we will approach these matters through thermodynamics, which will teach us that potential differences manifest free energy changes. That linkage will open a path to chemical information through electrochemical measurements. Subsequently, we will explore the physical mechanism by which potential differences are established, and we will gain insights relevant to the measurement and control of potential.

[^1]:    2 This net reaction will also occur without a flow of electrons in the external circuit, because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in solution will attack the zinc. This "side reaction," which happens to be identical with the electrochemical process, is slow if dilute acid is used.

[^2]:    3 In the thermodynamic convention, absorbed quantities are positive and evolved quantities are negative.

[^3]:    4 In some of the older literature, the standard emfs of reduction and oxidation are called the "reduction potential" and the "oxidation potential," respectively. These terms are intrinsically confusing and should be avoided altogether, because they conflate the chemical concept of reaction direction with the physical concept of electrical potential. 5 In 1982, the IUPAC redefined the standard pressure to $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ ( 1 bar) from $1 \mathrm{~atm}\left(1.01325 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}\right)$. Standard states were based before 1982 on the old standard pressure, and tabulations of standard data compiled before 1982 presumed those standard states. The change in the pressure standard is not consequential for most work in electrochemistry.

[^4]:    6 Sometimes one sees activity described as an "idealized concentration." Actually, it is the product of two things: (a) a normalized concentration relative to the standard state, and (b) a free-energy adjustment (expressed in the activity coefficient). Activity is needed for accuracy in equations based on free energies. It is, however, not the same as concentration. If a species is present at a given concentration in a solution for which the ionic strength is made to vary, its activity will change, but the number of molecules of that species per unit volume will not.

[^5]:    7 Experimental means for determining activity coefficients do not yield values for single ions, but generally a mean ionic activity coefficient, $\gamma_{ \pm}$. For a $1: 1$ electrolyte, such as $\mathrm{HCl}, \gamma_{ \pm}=\left(\gamma_{+} \gamma_{-}\right)^{1 / 2}$, where $\gamma_{+}$and $\gamma_{-}$are the single-ion values for the cation and anion, respectively.

[^6]:    8 A consequence of the 1982 change in standard pressure ${ }^{5}$ is that the potential of the NHE now differs from that used historically. The "new NHE" is +0.169 mV vs. the "old NHE" (based on a standard state of 1 atm ). This difference is rarely significant, and is never so in this book. Most tabulated standard potentials, including those in Table C.1, are referred to the old NHE. See reference (14).

[^7]:    9 Informally, and even in the literature, one commonly finds the practice of treating $a_{j}$ for a solute as though it could be written $\gamma_{j} C_{j}$. The activity coefficient is sometimes factored out, leaving the concentration. This cannot be correct, because activities and activity coefficients are unitless. If the activity coefficient is factored out, what is left behind must also be unitless. In reality, it is $a_{j} / \gamma_{j}=C_{j} / C_{j}^{0}$, not $C_{j}$. If $C_{j}$ is a molar concentration, then the standard state is 1 M , so $C_{j} / C_{j}^{0}$ has the numeric value of $C_{j}$ without the units. Thus, the common practice is numerically accurate, but not dimensionally so.

[^8]:    10 The presented value is justified in the cited references on the basis of direct measurements. It includes a junction potential at the reference electrode tip, which is uncertain by 1 mV or more (Section 2.3.5). Because of this uncertainty, one will sometimes see slightly different values of $E_{\text {ref }}$ used in the literature.
    11 One occasionally sees the potential of the SCE given as 0.2412 V vs. the "old" NHE (15, 19). This is a calculated value based on the standard potential for the couple and an experimentally determined $\gamma_{ \pm}$for saturated KCl . The discrepancy between calculated and measured values has been ascribed (15) to a difference between $\gamma_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}$and $\gamma_{ \pm}$, as well as to the junction potential. The measured value given in (2.1.54) has been recommended as more relevant to a practical SCE in use.

[^9]:    12 Sometimes, these devices are called dynamic hydrogen electrodes.

[^10]:    13 Also called the electrostatic potential.
    14 Although $\phi(x, y, z)$ is rigorously defined, it is not rigorously measurable. Only differences of electrical potential can be precisely measured, and then only under particular conditions (Section 2.2.3).

[^11]:    15 When current is passing through a phase, the potential within the phase is not constant. A difference in $\phi$ is needed between any two interior points to drive whatever current flows through the electrical resistance between those points. Such situations are encountered and discussed in Sections 1.5 and 4.2, but we will not address them in this chapter, which is focused on equilibrium.
    16 The parameter $\varepsilon_{0}$ is called the vacuum electric permittivity or the permittivity of free space and has the value $8.85419 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}^{2} \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}$. See the footnote in Section 14.3.1 for a fuller explanation of electrostatic conventions followed in this book.
    17 There can be a finite thickness to this surface layer. The critical aspect is the size of the excess charge with respect to the bulk carrier concentration in the phase. If the charge is established by drawing carriers from a significant

[^12]:    volume, thermal processes will impede the compact accumulation of the excess strictly on the surface. Then, the charged zone is called a space charge region, because it has three-dimensional character. Its thickness in electrolytes and semiconductors can range from a few tenths of a nm to thousands of nm . In metals, it is negligibly thick. See Chapters 14 and 21 for more detailed discussions.

[^13]:    20 As it can be with an ultramicroelectrode (Section 6.7).

[^14]:    21 Or the difference in work functions [(Section 2.2.5(d)].

[^15]:    22 This energy is also frequently called the Fermi level. More exactly, this is the energy where the occupation probability is 0.5 in the Fermi-Dirac distribution of electrons among the various energy levels. Sections 3.5.5 and 20.1.4 cover $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{F}}$ in more detail. If one adds an electron to the phase, it will equilibrate to the Fermi energy. If one removes an electron, it will "come from" (i.e., its vacancy will equilibrate to) the Fermi energy.
    23 The potential and the Fermi energy of an electrode have different signs because the potential is based on energy changes involving a positive test charge, while the Fermi energy refers to a negative electron.

[^16]:    24 The work function is the energy required to remove one electron from an uncharged surface of a solid into vacuum. For typical metals, the work function is $2-6 \mathrm{eV}$. The work function includes a surface energy in the definition of $\Phi_{\mathrm{M}}$, which we have neglected for this discussion, and which depends on the state of the surface, including crystallographic orientation, surface relaxation, adsorption, and solvent interactions (28, 34).

[^17]:    25 A cell like (2.3.3), having electrodes of the same type on both sides, but with differing activities of one or both redox forms, is called a concentration cell.

    (b) Moles of positive (or negative) charge per liter.

[^20]:    27 Equation 2.4.4 is derived from (2.4.2) by recognizing the test solution as phase $\alpha$ and the internal filling solution of the electrode as phase $\beta$. See also Figures 2.3.5 and 2.3.6.
    28 By the phrase "activity for species $j$," we mean the unitless concentration of $j$ multiplied by the mean ionic activity coefficient. ${ }^{9}$ See Sections 2.1.5 and 2.3.4 for more on the concept of single-ion activities.
    29 In routine practice, the constant term is not explicitly evaluated. Inside the pH meter, an offset voltage is added to the cell voltage and is manually adjusted so that the meter reads properly for the standard solution. When the test solution is substituted, the meter will accurately indicate the ionic activity, as long as the "constant" term remains unaltered upon the change of solution. This practice shows how changes of membrane potential underlie the operation of these devices. One must always make measurements against a calibration standard.

[^21]:    30 The diffusion term here is the same as would be predicted by the Henderson equation from the compositions of $m^{\prime}$ and $m^{\prime \prime}$ without considering $m$ as a separate phase. Many treatments of this problem follow such an approach. We have added phase $m$ because the three-phase model for the membrane is more realistic with regard to the assumptions underlying the Henderson equation.

[^23]:    31 Such materials are very different from the polymers that one normally encounters, which are either electrically insulating [e.g., poly(ethylene), poly(styrene) or Teflon ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ ] or purely ionically conducting [e.g., poly(styrenesulfonate) or Nafion ${ }^{\text {TM }}$ ]. Electronic conductivity can be engendered by partially oxidizing or partially reducing a polymer having electronically communicating (usually aromatic) monomer units (Section 20.2.3). Partial oxidation or partial reduction means that only a fraction of the monomer units are oxidized or reduced. Charge-compensating ions must enter the material during the oxidation or reduction process, which normally occurs electrochemically (often coincidentally with polymerization).
