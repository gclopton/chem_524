# 2.3 Liquid Junction Potentials

So far in this chapter, we have examined only systems at equilibrium, and we have learned that the potential differences in equilibrated electrochemical systems can be treated exactly by thermodynamics. However, many real cells are never at equilibrium, because they feature different electrolytes around the working and reference electrodes. There is an interface between the two solutions, where mass transport processes work to mix the solutes. Unless the solutions are the same initially, this liquid junction will not be at equilibrium, because net flows of mass occur continuously across it.

## 2.3.1 Potential Differences at an Electrolyte-Electrolyte Boundary

Consider the cell

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(0.1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}(0.2 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{Cu}^{2+} \underset{\beta}{(0.1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}(0.2 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}} \tag{2.3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

for which we can depict the equilibrium processes as in Figure 2.3.1. The overall cell potential at null current is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=\left(\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\beta}\right)-\left(\phi^{\mathrm{Cu}}-\phi^{\alpha}\right)+\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}\right) \tag{2.3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

The first two components of $E$ are the expected interfacial potential differences at the copper and zinc electrodes. The third term shows that the measured cell potential depends also on the potential difference between the electrolytes, that is, on the liquid junction potential. This discovery threatens our system of electrode potentials, which is based on the idea that all contributions to $E$ can be assigned to one electrode or to the other. The junction potential cannot be so assigned. We must evaluate the importance of the phenomenon.

## 2.3.2 Types of Liquid Junctions

The reality of junction potentials is easily understood by considering the boundary shown in Figure 2.3.2a. At the junction, there is a steep concentration gradient in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$; hence, both ions tend to diffuse from right to left. However, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$has a much larger mobility than chloride, so it initially penetrates the dilute phase at a higher rate. This process gives a positive charge to the dilute phase and a negative charge to the concentrated one, with the result that a boundary potential difference develops. The corresponding electric field then retards the movement of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and speeds up the passage of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$until the two cross the boundary at equal rates. Because of the

Figure 2.3.1 Phase boundaries in (2.3.1). Equilibrium is established for certain charge carriers as shown, but equilibrium is not reached at the liquid junction between $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

charge separation, a detectable potential difference develops, which is not due to an equilibrium process (3, 26, 38, 39). From its origin, this interfacial potential is sometimes called a diffusion potential.

Lingane (3) classified liquid junctions into three types:

- Two solutions of the same electrolyte at different concentrations, as in Figure 2.3.2a.
- Two solutions at the same concentration with different electrolytes having an ion in common, as in Figure 2.3.2b.
- Two solutions not satisfying conditions 1 or 2, as in Figure 2.3.2c.

This classification will prove useful in the treatments of junction potentials given below.
Even though the boundary region cannot be at equilibrium, it has a composition that is effectively constant over long periods of time, and the reversible transfer of charge through the region can be considered.

## 2.3.3 Conductance, Transference Numbers, and Mobility

When an electric current flows in an electrochemical cell, it is carried in solution by the movement of ions. For example, take the following cell:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\ominus \mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(1 \mathrm{bar}) / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(1 \mathrm{bar}) / \mathrm{Pt}^{\prime} \oplus \\
\alpha\left(a_{1}\right) \quad \beta\left(a_{2}\right) \tag{2.3.3}
\end{gather*}
$$

where $a_{2}>a_{1} \cdot{ }^{25}$ When the cell operates galvanically (i.e., spontaneously), an oxidation occurs at the left electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{H}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\alpha)+2 e(\mathrm{Pt}) \tag{2.3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

and a reduction happens on the right,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\beta)+2 e\left(\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}\right) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{2.3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

There is a tendency to build up positive charge in the $\alpha$ phase and negative charge in $\beta$. This tendency is overcome by the movement of ions: $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the right and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to the left. For each mole of electrons passed, 1 mole of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is produced in $\alpha$, and 1 mole of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is consumed in $\beta$. The total amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$migrating across the boundary between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must equal 1 mole.

[^17]The fractions of the current carried by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are called their transference numbers. ${ }^{26}$ If we let $t_{+}$be the transference number for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $t_{-}$be that for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, then,

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{+}+t_{-}=1 \tag{2.3.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

In general, for an electrolyte containing many ions, $\mathfrak{j}$, each ion carries some of the current, so

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j} t_{j}=1 \tag{2.3.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Schematically, the process in the cell can be represented as shown in Figure 2.3.3. Initially, there is a higher activity of hydrochloric acid on the right (Figure 2.3.3a); hence, discharge spontaneously produces $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on the left and consumes it on the right. Assume that five units of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are produced and consumed as shown in Figure 2.3.3b. For hydrochloric acid, $t_{+} \approx 0.8$ and $t_{-} \approx 0.2$; therefore, four units of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$migrate to the right and one unit of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to the left, to maintain electroneutrality. This process is depicted in Figure 2.3.3c, and the final state of the solution is represented in Figure 2.3.3d.

A charge imbalance like that suggested in Figure 2.3.3b could not actually occur, because a very large electric field would be established, which would work to erase the imbalance. On a macroscopic scale, electroneutrality is steadily maintained throughout the solution. The migration represented in Figure 2.3.3c occurs simultaneously with the electron-transfer reactions.

Transference numbers are determined by the details of ionic conduction, which have become understood mainly through measurements of the resistance to current flow in solution, or of its reciprocal, the conductance, $G(39,40)$. The value of $G$ for a segment of solution immersed in an electric field is directly proportional to the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the field vector, $A$, and is inversely proportional to the length, $l$, of the segment along the field. The proportionality constant is the conductivity, $\kappa$, which is an intrinsic property of the solution:

$$
\begin{equation*}
G=\kappa A / l \tag{2.3.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $G$ is given in units of siemens ( $\mathrm{S}=\Omega^{-1}$ ), and $\kappa$ is in $\mathrm{Scm}^{-1}$ or $\Omega^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$.
Since the passage of current through the solution is accomplished by the independent movement of different species, $\kappa$ is the sum of contributions from all ionic species, $j$. It is intuitive that the jth component of $\kappa$ is proportional to the concentration of the ion, the magnitude of its charge $\left|z_{j}\right|$, and some index of its migration velocity.

Figure 2.3.4 Forces on a charged particle moving in solution under the influence of an electric field. The forces balance at the terminal velocity.

That index is the mobility, $u_{j}$, which is the limiting velocity of the ion in an electric field of unit strength. Mobility usually carries dimensions of $\mathrm{cm}^{2} \mathrm{~V}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ (i.e., $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ per $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{cm}$ ). When a field of strength $\mathcal{E}$ is applied to an ion, it will accelerate under the force imposed by the field until the frictional drag exactly counterbalances the electric force. Then, the ion continues its motion at that terminal velocity. This balance is represented in Figure 2.3.4.

The magnitude of the force exerted by the field is $\left|z_{j}\right| e \mathcal{E}$, where $e$ is the electronic charge. The frictional drag can be approximated from the Stokes law as $6 \pi \eta r v$, where $\eta$ is the viscosity of the medium, $r$ is the radius of the ion, and $v$ is the velocity. When the terminal velocity is reached, we have by equation and rearrangement,

$$
\begin{equation*}
u_{j}=\frac{v}{\mathcal{E}}=\frac{\left|z_{j}\right| e}{6 \pi \eta r} \tag{2.3.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The proportionality factor relating an individual ionic conductivity to charge, mobility, and concentration turns out to be the Faraday constant; thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\kappa=F \sum_{j}\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j} C_{j} \tag{2.3.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

The transference number for species $j$ is the contribution to conductivity made by that species divided by the total conductivity:

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{j}=\frac{\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j} C_{j}}{\sum_{\mathrm{k}}\left|z_{\mathrm{k}}\right| u_{\mathrm{k}} C_{\mathrm{k}}} \tag{2.3.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

For solutions of simple, pure electrolytes (i.e., one positive and one negative ionic species), such as $\mathrm{KCl}, \mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$, conductance is often quantified in terms of the equivalent conductivity, $\Lambda$, which is defined by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda=\frac{\kappa}{C_{\mathrm{eq}}} \tag{2.3.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $C_{\text {eq }}$ is the concentration of positive (or negative) charges (often called the equivalent concentration). Thus, $\Lambda$ expresses the conductivity per unit concentration of charge. Since $|z| C=C_{\text {eq }}$ for either ionic species in these systems, one finds from (2.3.10) and (2.3.12) that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda=F\left(u_{+}+u_{-}\right) \tag{2.3.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $u_{+}$refers to the cation and $u_{-}$to the anion. This relation suggests that $\Lambda$ could be regarded as the sum of individual equivalent ionic conductivities,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda=\lambda_{+}+\lambda_{-} \tag{2.3.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

hence, we find

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{j}=F u_{j} \tag{2.3.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

In these simple solutions, then, the transference number $t_{j}$ is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{j}=\frac{\lambda_{j}}{\Lambda} \tag{2.3.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

or, alternatively,

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{j}=\frac{u_{j}}{u_{+}+u_{-}} \tag{2.3.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Transference numbers can be measured by several approaches (39, 40), and numerous data for pure solutions appear in the literature. Frequently, transference numbers are measured by noting concentration changes caused by electrolysis (Problem 2.11), as in the experiment shown in Figure 2.3.3. Table 2.3.1 displays a few values for aqueous solutions at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. From results of this sort, one can evaluate the individual ionic conductivities, $\lambda_{j}$. Both $\lambda_{j}$ and $t_{j}$ vary with the concentration of the pure electrolyte, because interactions between ions tend to alter the mobilities $(39,40,42)$. Lists of $\lambda_{j}$ values, like Table 2.3.2, usually give $\lambda_{0 j}$, which are limits obtained by extrapolation to infinite dilution. In the absence of measured transference numbers, it is convenient to use values of $\lambda_{0 j}$ to estimate $t_{j}$ for pure solutions by (2.3.16), or for mixed electrolytes by the following equivalent to (2.3.11),

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{j}=\frac{\left|z_{j}\right| C_{j} \lambda_{j}}{\sum_{\mathrm{k}}\left|z_{\mathrm{k}}\right| C_{\mathrm{k}} \lambda_{\mathrm{k}}} \tag{2.3.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Solid electrolytes also exist and are sometimes used in electrochemical cells. Examples include sodium $\beta$-alumina, the silver halides, and polymers like polyethylene oxide/ $\mathrm{LiClO}_{4}$ (44, 45). In these materials, ions move under the influence of an electric field, even in the absence of solvent. For example, the conductivity of a single crystal of sodium $\beta$-alumina at room temperature is $0.035 \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$, a value similar to that of aqueous solutions. Solid electrolytes are technologically important in the fabrication of batteries and other electrochemical devices. In some of these materials (e.g., $\alpha-\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ and AgBr )-and unlike essentially all liquid electrolytes-there is electronic conductivity as well as ionic conductivity. The relative

contribution of electronic conduction through the solid electrolyte can be found by applying a potential that is too small to drive electrochemical reactions and noting the magnitude of the (nonfaradaic) current. Alternatively, an electrolysis can be carried out and the faradaic contribution determined separately (Problem 2.12).

## 2.3.4 Calculation of Liquid Junction Potentials

Imagine concentration cell (2.3.3) connected to a power supply as shown in Figure 2.3.5. The voltage from the supply opposes that from the cell, and one finds experimentally that it is possible to oppose the cell voltage exactly, so that no current flows through the galvanometer. If the magnitude of the opposing voltage is reduced very slightly, the cell

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/dcd16870-e92a-4132-8bc7-8607da66507c-36.jpg?height=397&width=657&top_left_y=1896&top_left_x=189)
Figure 2.3.5 System for demonstrating reversible flow of charge through a cell with a liquid junction. Device $G$ is a galvanometer, a high-sensitivity ammeter able to show the existence and direction of a current. One finds the electrical balance point by adjusting the potentiometer (Figure 1.2.4) so that $G$ shows null current.

operates spontaneously as described above, and electrons flow from $\mathrm{Pt}^{\circ}$ to $\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}$ in the external circuit. The process occurring at the liquid junction is the passage of an equivalent negative charge from right to left. If the opposing voltage is increased from the null point, the entire process reverses, including charge transfer through the interface between the electrolytes. The fact that an infinitesimal change in the driving force can reverse the direction of charge passage implies that the electrochemical free energy change for the whole process is zero.

These events can be divided into those involving the chemical transformations at the metal/solution interfaces,

$$
\begin{align*}
& 1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(\alpha)+e(\mathrm{Pt})  \tag{2.3.19}\\
& \mathrm{H}^{+}(\beta)+e\left(\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}\right) \rightleftharpoons 1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{2.3.20}
\end{align*}
$$

and that effecting charge transport at the liquid junction depicted in Figure 2.3.6,

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{+} \mathrm{H}^{+}(\alpha)+t_{-} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\beta) \rightleftharpoons t_{+} \mathrm{H}^{+}(\beta)+t_{-} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\alpha) \tag{2.3.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since (2.3.19) and (2.3.20) are at strict equilibrium under the null-current condition, the electrochemical free energy change for each of them individually is zero. Of course, this is also true for their sum,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{H}^{+}(\beta)+e\left(\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}\right) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(\alpha)+e(\mathrm{Pt}) \tag{2.3.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

which describes the chemical change in the system. The sum of this equation and the charge transport relation, (2.3.21), describes the overall cell operation. Since we have just learned that the electrochemical free energy changes for both the overall process and (2.3.22) are zero, we must conclude that the electrochemical free energy change for (2.3.21) is also zero. In other words, charge transport across the junction occurs in such a way that the electrochemical free energy change vanishes, even though it is not a process at equilibrium. This important conclusion permits an approach to the calculation of junction potentials.

Let us focus first on the net chemical reaction, (2.3.22). Since the electrochemical free energy change is zero,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}+}^{\alpha}+\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{e}}^{\mathrm{Pt}}  \tag{2.3.23}\\
& F E=F\left(\phi^{\mathrm{Pt}^{\prime}}-\phi^{\mathrm{Pt}}\right)=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}  \tag{2.3.24}\\
& E=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}+\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}\right) \tag{2.3.25}
\end{align*}
$$

The first component of $E$ in (2.3.25) is the Nernst relation for the reversible chemical change, and $\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}$ is the liquid junction potential, $E_{j}$. In general, for a chemically reversible system under null current conditions,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\text {cell }}=E_{\text {Nernst }}+E_{j} \tag{2.3.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

The junction potential is an additive perturbation onto the nernstian response.

To evaluate $E_{j}$, we consider (2.3.21), for which

$$
\begin{equation*}
t_{+} \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}+t_{-} \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\beta}=t_{+} \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}+t_{-} \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\alpha} \tag{2.3.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
& t_{+}\left(\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}\right)+t_{-}\left(\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\beta}-\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\alpha}\right)=0  \tag{2.3.28}\\
& t_{+}\left[R T \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}}+F\left(\phi^{\alpha}-\phi^{\beta}\right)\right]+t_{-}\left[R T \ln \frac{a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\beta}}{a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\alpha}}-F\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}\right)\right]=0 \tag{2.3.29}
\end{align*}
$$

Activity coefficients for single ions cannot be measured with thermodynamic rigor ( $2,38,46$, 47); hence, they are usually equated to a measurable mean ionic activity coefficient (Section 2.1.5). Under this procedure, $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\alpha}=a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\alpha}=a_{1}$ and $a_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}^{\beta}=a_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{\beta}=a_{2}$. Since $t_{+}+t_{-}=1$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{j}=\left(\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}\right)=\left(t_{+}-t_{-}\right) \frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}} \tag{2.3.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

for a Type 1 junction involving $1: 1$ electrolytes.
Consider, for example, HCl solutions with $a_{1}=0.01$ and $a_{2}=0.1$. We can see from Table 2.3.1 that $t_{+}=0.83$ and $t_{-}=0.17$; hence, at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{j}=(0.83-0.17)(59.1) \log \left(\frac{0.01}{0.1}\right)=-39 \mathrm{mV} \tag{2.3.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the total cell,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=59.1 \log \frac{a_{2}}{a_{1}}+E_{j}=59-39=20 \mathrm{mV} \tag{2.3.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

thus, the junction potential is a substantial component of the measured cell potential.
In the derivation above, we implicitly assumed that the transference numbers were constant throughout the system. This is a good approximation for junctions of Type 1; hence, (2.3.30) is not seriously compromised. For Type 2 and Type 3 systems, it clearly cannot be true. To consider these cases, one must imagine the junction region to be sectioned into an infinite number of volume elements having compositions that range smoothly from that of pure $\alpha$ to that of pure $\beta$. Transporting charge across one of these elements involves every ionic species in the element, and $t_{j} /\left|z_{j}\right|$ moles of species $j$ must move for each mole of charge passed. Thus, the passage of positive charge from $\alpha$ toward $\beta$ might be depicted as in Figure 2.3.7. One can see that the change in electrochemical free energy upon moving any species is $\left(t_{j} / z_{j}\right) d \bar{\mu}_{j}$ (recall that $z_{j}$ is signed ); therefore, the overall differential electrochemical free energy is

$$
\begin{equation*}
d \bar{G}=\sum_{j} \frac{t_{j}}{z_{j}} d \bar{\mu}_{j} \tag{2.3.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

Integrating from the $\alpha$ phase to the $\beta$ phase, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\alpha}^{\beta} d \bar{G}=0=\sum_{j} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{t_{j}}{z_{j}} d \bar{\mu}_{j} \tag{2.3.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $\mu_{j}^{0}$ for the $\alpha$ phase is the same as that for the $\beta$ phase (e.g., if both are aqueous solutions),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{t_{j}}{z_{j}} R T d \ln a_{j}+\left(\sum_{j} t_{j}\right) F \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} d \phi=0 \tag{2.3.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 2.3.7 Transfer of net positive charge from left to right through an infinitesimal segment of a junction region. Each species must contribute $t_{j}$ moles of charge per mole of overall charge transported; hence, $t_{j} /\left|z_{j}\right|$ moles of that species must migrate.

Since $\sum t_{j}=1$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{j}=\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}=-\frac{R T}{F} \sum_{j} \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \frac{t_{j}}{z_{j}} d \ln a_{j} \tag{2.3.36}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the general expression for the junction potential. It is easy to see now that (2.3.30) is a special case for Type 1 junctions between 1:1 electrolytes having constant $t_{j}$.

Note that $E_{j}$ for a Type 1 junction is a strong function of $t_{+}-t_{-}$and vanishes if $t_{+}=t_{-}$. Thus, the cell

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{KCl}(0.1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{KCl}(0.01 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.3.37}
\end{equation*}
$$

which has $t_{+}=0.49$ and $t_{-}=0.51$, shows $E_{j}=-1.2 \mathrm{mV}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a figure 30 times smaller than for the HCl -based cell discussed above.

While Type 1 junctions can be treated with some rigor and are independent of the method of forming the junction, Type 2 and Type 3 junctions have potentials that depend on the technique of junction formation (e.g., static or flowing) and can be treated only in an approximate manner. Different approaches to junction formation apparently lead to different profiles of $t_{j}$ through the junction, which in turn lead to different integrals for (2.3.36). Approximate values for $E_{j}$ can be obtained by assuming that

- Molar concentrations of ions everywhere in the junction are numerically equivalent to activities. ${ }^{9}$
- The concentration of each ion follows a linear transition between the two phases.

One can then integrate (2.3.36) to give the Henderson equation (26,38):

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{j}=\frac{\sum_{j} \frac{\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j}}{z_{j}}\left[C_{j}(\beta)-C_{j}(\alpha)\right]}{\sum_{j}\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j}\left[C_{j}(\beta)-C_{j}(\alpha)\right]} \frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\sum_{j}\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j} C_{j}(\alpha)}{\sum_{j}\left|z_{j}\right| u_{j} C_{j}(\beta)} \tag{2.3.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $u_{j}$ is the mobility of species $j$, and $C_{j}$ is its molar concentration (without units).

For Type 2 junctions between 1:1 electrolytes, this equation collapses to the Lewis-Sargent relation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{j}= \pm \frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\Lambda_{\beta}}{\Lambda_{\alpha}} \tag{2.3.39}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the positive sign corresponds to a junction with a common cation in the two phases, and the negative sign applies to the case with a common anion. As an example, consider the cell

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{HCl}(0.1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{KCl}(0.1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.3.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

for which $E_{\text {cell }}$ is essentially $E_{j}$. The measured value at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $28 \pm 1 \mathrm{mV}$, depending on the technique of junction formation (38), while the estimated value from (2.3.39) and the data of Table 2.3.2 is 26.8 mV .

## 2.3.5 Minimizing Liquid Junction Potentials

In most electrochemical experiments, the junction potential is a bothersome factor, so attempts are often made to minimize it. Alternatively, one hopes that it is small or that it at least remains constant. A method for minimizing $E_{j}$ is to replace the junction, for example,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{HCl}\left(C_{1}\right) / \mathrm{NaCl}\left(C_{2}\right) \tag{2.3.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

with a system featuring a concentrated solution in an intermediate salt bridge, where the solution in the bridge has ions of nearly equal mobility. Such a system is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{HCl}\left(C_{1}\right) / \mathrm{KCl}(C) / \mathrm{NaCl}\left(C_{2}\right) \tag{2.3.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Table 2.3.3 lists some measured junction potentials for the cell,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{HCl}(0.1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{C}) / \mathrm{KCl}(0.1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{Hg} \tag{2.3.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

As $C$ increases, $E_{j}$ falls markedly, because ionic transport at the two junctions is dominated more extensively by the massive amounts of KCl . The series junctions become more similar in magnitude and have opposite polarities; hence, they tend to cancel. Solutions used in aqueous salt bridges usually contain $\mathrm{KCl}\left(t_{+}=0.49, t_{-}=0.51\right)$ or, where $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is deleterious, $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}\left(t_{+}=0.51, t_{-}=0.49\right)$. Other concentrated solutions with equitransferent ions that have been suggested (52) for salt bridges include $\mathrm{CsCl}\left(t_{+}=0.5025\right), \mathrm{RbBr}\left(t_{+}=0.4958\right)$, and $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{I}$ ( $t_{+}=0.4906$ ).

For many measurements, such as the determination of pH , it is sufficient if the junction potential remains constant between calibration (e.g., with a standard buffer or solution) and measurement. However, variations in $E_{j}$ of $1-2 \mathrm{mV}$ can be expected and should be considered in any interpretations made from potentiometric data.

## 2.3.6 Junctions of Two Immiscible Liquids

Another kind of junction is that between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (53-57). A typical case would be

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left.\underset{\text { phase } \alpha}{\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)}\right) \underset{\text { phase } \beta}{\mathrm{TBA}^{+} \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}} \text {(nitrobenzene) } \tag{2.3.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathrm{TBA}^{+} \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$is tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate. Cells with immiscible liquids between two aqueous phases, such as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{aq}) / \mathrm{TBA}^{+} \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}(\text {nitrobenzene }) / \mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{aq}) / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{2.3.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

are of interest for use in ion-selective electrodes (Section 2.4.3) and as models for biological membranes. The treatment of the potentials across junctions like (2.3.44) is similar to that given earlier in this section, except that the standard chemical potentials, $\mu_{j}^{0 \alpha}$ and $\mu_{j}^{0 \beta}$, are now different for any species $j$ in the two phases. At equilibrium, $\bar{\mu}_{j}^{\alpha}=\bar{\mu}_{j}^{\beta}$, so the interfacial potential difference becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\phi^{\beta}-\phi^{\alpha}=-\frac{1}{z_{j} F}\left[\Delta G_{\text {transfer }, j}^{0 \alpha \rightarrow \beta}+R T \ln \left(\frac{a_{j}^{\beta}}{a_{j}^{\alpha}}\right)\right] \tag{2.3.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Delta G_{\text {transfer, } j}^{0 \alpha \rightarrow \beta}$ is the standard free energy required to transfer species $j$ with charge $z_{j}$ between the two phases and is defined as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\text {transfer }, j}^{0 \alpha \rightarrow \beta}=\mu_{j}^{0 \beta}-\mu_{j}^{0 \alpha} \tag{2.3.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

This quantity can be estimated from solubility data, but only with an extrathermodynamic assumption of some kind. For example, for the salt tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate ( $\mathrm{TPAs}{ }^{+} \mathrm{TPB}^{-}$), it is widely assumed that the free energy of solvation ( $\Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}$ ) of TPAs ${ }^{+}$is equal to that of $\mathrm{TPB}^{-}$, since both are large ions with most of the charge buried deep inside the surrounding phenyl rings (58). Consequently, the individual ion solvation energies are taken as half of the solvation energy of the salt, which is measurable from the solubility product in a given solvent. That is,

$$
\begin{align*}
\Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}\left(\mathrm{TPAs}^{+}\right) & =\Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}\left(\mathrm{TPB}^{-}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}\left(\mathrm{TPAs}^{+} \mathrm{TPB}^{-}\right)  \tag{2.3.48}\\
\Delta G_{\text {transfer, } \mathrm{TPAs}^{+}}^{0 \alpha \rightarrow \beta} & =\Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}\left(\mathrm{TPAs}^{+}, \beta\right)-\Delta G_{\text {solvn }}^{0}\left(\mathrm{TPAs}^{+}, \alpha\right) \tag{2.3.49}
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, $\Delta G_{\text {transfer, } j}^{0 \alpha \rightarrow \beta}$ might be obtained from the partitioning of the salt between phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$. For each ion, the value determined in this way should be the same as that calculated in (2.3.49), if the intersolubility of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is very small.

The rate of ion transfer across interfaces between immiscible liquids is also of interest and can be studied electrochemically (Section 7.8).
