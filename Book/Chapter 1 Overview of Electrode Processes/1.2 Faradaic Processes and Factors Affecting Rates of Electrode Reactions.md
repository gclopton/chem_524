# 1.2 Faradaic Processes and Factors Affecting Rates of Electrode Reactions

### 1.2.1 Electrochemical Cells-Types and Definitions

Electrochemical cells in which faradaic currents are flowing are classified as either galvanic or electrolytic cells.

A galvanic cell is one in which reactions occur spontaneously at the electrodes when they are connected externally by a conductor (Figure 1.2.1a). These cells are often employed in converting chemical energy into electrical energy. Galvanic cells of commercial importance include primary (nonrechargeable) cells (e.g., the "alkaline" $\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ cell), secondary (rechargeable) cells (e.g., a charged $\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{PbO}_{2}$ storage battery or lithium-ion battery), and fuel cells (e.g., an $\mathrm{H}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ cell).

An electrolytic cell is one in which electrode reactions that would not occur spontaneously are driven by the imposition of an external voltage greater than the open-circuit potential of

the cell (Figure 1.2.1b). These cells are frequently employed to carry out desired chemical reactions by expending electrical energy. Commercial processes involving electrolytic cells include electrolytic syntheses (e.g., the production of chlorine and aluminum), electrorefining (e.g., copper), and electroplating (e.g., silver and gold). The lead-acid storage cell (or any other secondary cell) is an electrolytic cell when it is being recharged, but is a galvanic cell when it is delivering power.

Although it is sometimes convenient to make a distinction between galvanic and electrolytic cells, we will most often be concerned with reactions occurring at only one of the electrodes. Treatment is simplified by concentrating our attention on only one-half of the cell at a time. If necessary, the behavior of a whole cell (i.e., whether galvanic or electrolytic) can be ascertained later by combining the characteristics of the individual half-cells.

The behavior of a single electrode and the fundamental nature of its reactions are independent of whether the electrode is part of a galvanic or electrolytic cell. For example, consider the cells in Figure 1.2.1. The reaction $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$ is the same in both cells. If one desires to plate copper, one could accomplish this either in a galvanic cell (using a counter half-cell with a more negative potential than that of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cu}$ ) or in an electrolytic cell (using any counter half-cell and driving electrons to the copper electrode with an external power supply).

Electrolysis is a term that we define broadly to include chemical changes accompanying faradaic reactions at electrodes in contact with electrolytes. In discussing cells, one calls the electrode at which reductions occur the cathode, and the electrode at which oxidations occur the anode. A current in which electrons cross the interface from the electrode to a species in solution is a cathodic current, while electron flow from a solution species into the electrode is an anodic current. In an electrolytic cell, the cathode is negative with respect to the anode; but in a galvanic cell, the cathode is positive with respect to the anode. ${ }^{19}$

### 1.2.2 The Electrochemical Experiment and Variables in Electrochemical Cells

An experimental investigation of electrochemical behavior consists of controlling certain variables of a cell and observing how other variables (usually current, potential, or concentration) vary with time or with the controlled variables. The parameters of importance in

Figure 1.2.2 Variables affecting the rate of an electrode reaction.

electrochemical cells are shown in Figure 1.2.2. Methods fall into broad categories; the following illustrate some of the differences in approach:

- In potentiometry, $i=0$, and $E$ is determined as a function of concentration. Since no current flows in this experiment, no net faradaic reaction occurs, and the potential is frequently (but not always) governed by the thermodynamic properties of the system. Many of the variables (electrode area, mass transfer, electrode geometry) do not affect the potential directly.
- In voltammetry, the potential is controlled (normally following a particular function of time), and the resulting current is measured as a function of potential.
- In galvanostatic experiments, the current is controlled (usually as a defined function of time) and the potential is followed vs. time.
- In coulometry, the potential is held constant at a value where an electrode reaction occurs, and one measures the total charge passed, usually by integrating the current.

Most electrochemical experiments can be described in terms of the way in which the system responds to a perturbation. A certain excitation function (e.g., a potential step) is applied, and a certain response function (e.g., the resulting variation of current with time) is measured, with all other system variables held constant (Figure 1.2.3). If the excitation is time dependent, the response typically will also be a function of time. Such approaches are called transient methods. Alternatively, the excitation might be constant or a very slowly changing function of time, and the response might be steady with time. Approaches based on this concept are called steady-state methods.

The aim of the experiment is to obtain information (thermodynamic, kinetic, analytical, etc.) from observations of excitation and response functions and a knowledge of appropriate models for the system. This same basic idea is used in many other types of investigation, such as circuit testing or spectrophotometric analysis. In spectrophotometry, the excitation function is light of different wavelengths; the response function is the fraction of light transmitted by the system at these wavelengths; the system model is Beer's law or a molecular model; and the

information content includes the concentrations of absorbing species, their absorptivities, or their transition energies.

Before developing some models for electrochemical systems, let us examine more closely the nature of the current and potential in an electrochemical cell. Consider Figure 1.2.4, in which a cadmium electrode immersed in $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ is coupled to an SCE. The open-circuit potential of the cell is 0.64 V , with the copper wire attached to the cadmium electrode being

Figure 1.2.4 Schematic cell connected to an external power supply. The resistor with an adjustable intermediate contact is called a potentiometer. The double slash in the cell notation indicates an interface between two different electrolytes (a liquid junction) with a negligible potential difference. To avoid contamination of the mercury pool in the SCE by dissolved copper, Pt is used as intermediate contact.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 e=\mathrm{Cd} & E^{0}=-0.40 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. NHE } \\

\end{array}

negative with respect to that attached to the mercury electrode. ${ }^{20}$ When the voltage applied by the external power supply, $E_{\text {appl }}$, is 0.64 V , it exactly cancels the cell's open-circuit potential. There is no net driving force for the movement of charge, so $i=0$. When $E_{\text {appl }}$ is made larger (i.e., $E_{\text {appl }}>0.64 \mathrm{~V}$, such that the cadmium electrode is made even more negative with respect to the SCE), the power supply can drive electrons into the cadmium and withdraw them at the mercury. At the cadmium electrode, the reaction $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{Cd}$ occurs, while at the SCE, mercury is oxidized to $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$. The cell is electrolytic; the power supply is overcoming the spontaneous driving force of the cell. A question of interest might be: "If $E_{\text {appl }}=0.80 \mathrm{~V}$ (i.e., if the potential of the cadmium electrode is made -0.80 V vs. the SCE), what current will flow?" As we learned in Section 1.1.5, the question "What is $i$ ?" is, for this system, essentially the same as "What is the rate of the reaction, $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{Cd}$ ?"

Information about an electrode reaction is often gained by determining the current at the working electrode as a function of potential, i.e., by obtaining $i-E$ curves. Certain terms are sometimes associated with features of the curves. ${ }^{21}$ If a working electrode has a defined equilibrium potential, $E_{\text {eq }}$, that potential is an important reference point [Section 1.1.7(a)]. The departure of the electrode potential from the equilibrium value upon passage of faradaic current is termed polarization, which is measured by the overpotential, $\eta,{ }^{22}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=E-E_{\mathrm{eq}} \tag{1.2.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Current-potential curves, particularly those obtained under steady-state conditions, are sometimes called polarization curves.

An ideally nonpolarizable electrode (INE) is an electrode whose potential does not change upon passage of current, i.e., an electrode of fixed potential. ${ }^{23,24}$ Ideal nonpolarizability is characterized by a vertical region on an $i-E$ curve (Figure 1.2.5a). An SCE constructed with a sizable mercury pool would approach ideal nonpolarizability for small currents.

In contrast, an ideally polarizable electrode (IPE) shows a very large change in potential upon the passage of an infinitesimal current; thus, ideal polarizability is characterized by a horizontal, zero-current $i-E$ curve (Figure 1.2.5b and Section 1.6.1).

### 1.2.3 Factors Affecting Electrode Reaction Rate and Current

Consider an overall electrode reaction, $\mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$, composed of a series of steps that cause the conversion of the dissolved oxidized species, O , to a reduced form, R , also in solution

Figure 1.2.5 Current-potential curves for (a) INE and (b) IPE. Dashed lines show behavior of actual electrodes that approach ideal behavior over limited ranges of current or potential. Departures from ideality in (a) reflect limitations in the kinetics of the electrode reaction. In (b), they arise from the onset of new electrode reactions.

(Figure 1.2.6). In general, the current (or electrode reaction rate) is governed by the rates of processes such as $(1,2)$ :

- Mass transfer (e.g., of O from the bulk solution ${ }^{25}$ to the electrode surface).
- Electron transfer at the electrode surface.

Figure 1.2.6 Pathway of a general electrode reaction.

[^12]- Chemical reactions preceding or following the electron transfer. These might be homogeneous processes (e.g., protonation or dimerization) or heterogeneous reactions on the electrode surface (e.g., catalytic decomposition).
- Other surface reactions, such as adsorption, desorption, or crystallization.

The rate constants for some of these processes (e.g., electron transfer at the electrode surface or adsorption) depend upon the potential.

The simplest reactions involve only mass transfer of a reactant to the electrode, heterogeneous electron transfer involving nonadsorbed species, and mass transfer of the product to the bulk solution. A representative reaction of this sort is the reduction of the aromatic hydrocarbon 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA; Figure 1) to the radical anion (DPA $\bar{\bullet}$ ) in an aprotic solvent [e.g., $N, N$-dimethylformamide (DMF)]. More complex reaction sequences are quite common. They may involve almost any kind of chemistry, including a series of electron transfers, coupling reactions in solution, protonations, branching mechanisms, parallel paths, or modifications of the electrode surface.

It is possible in several ways to obtain steady-state currents, and we will concentrate on such situations in Sections 1.3 and 1.4. When there is a steady current, the rates of all reaction steps in a mechanistic series are the same. The magnitude of this current is often limited by the inherent sluggishness of one or more processes called rate-determining steps. The more facile steps are held back from their maximum rates by the slowness with which a rate-determining step disposes of their products or delivers their reactants.

Each value of current is driven by a certain overpotential, $\eta$, which can be considered as a sum of terms associated with the different reaction steps: $\eta_{\mathrm{mt}}$ (the mass-transfer overpotential), $\eta_{\mathrm{ct}}$ (the charge-transfer overpotential), $\eta_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ (the overpotential associated with a preceding reaction), etc. The overpotential of any step is an expression of how the applied electrical energy activates that step to operate at the rate required to deliver the given current density. Since $-\eta / i$ has units of resistance, the electrode reaction can be represented by an overall resistance, $R$, composed of a series of resistances representing the various steps: $R_{\mathrm{mt}}, R_{\mathrm{ct}}$, etc. (Figure 1.2.7). A kinetically facile, easily driven reaction step is characterized by a small resistance, while a sluggish step is represented by a high resistance. ${ }^{26}$
