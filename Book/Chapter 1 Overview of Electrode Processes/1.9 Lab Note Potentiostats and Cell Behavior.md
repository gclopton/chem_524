# 1.9 Lab Note: Potentiostats and Cell Behavior

This note is intended to help the reader to gain practical familiarity with a basic electrochemical instrument, with electrical responses of cells, and with some instrumental limitations.

### 1.9.1 Potentiostats

To carry out the suggested work, you will need access to a potentiostat - the central tool in most electrochemical laboratories. This is a device for controlling a three-electrode cell and for providing information about its behavior. The potentiostat essentially manifests the functions surrounding the cell in Figure 1.5.5. It normally connects to the working, reference, and counter electrodes through a cable with clip leads. ${ }^{59}$

A potentiostat uses feedback circuitry to automatically control the power delivered between the working and counter electrodes, so that $E_{\text {appl }}$, the voltage applied at the working electrode vs. the reference, remains continuously equal to a programmed value, even if that value changes with time (see also Figure 5.1.1 and related discussion). The voltage across the current-carrying path (working electrode to counter electrode) and the current in that path are functions of $E_{\text {appl }}$ and its time dependence. Within practical limits, the potentiostat will deliver whatever is needed to fulfill the control condition. Common potentiostats can place $\pm 13-14 \mathrm{~V}$ across the cell and can furnish a current of $\pm 100 \mathrm{~mA}$. "Powerful" instruments can deliver $\pm 100 \mathrm{~V}$ and $\pm 1 \mathrm{~A}$. Chapter 16 provides extensive discussion of these systems.

As discussed in Section 1.6.4(d), $E_{\text {appl }}$ is a continuous target for the actual working electrode potential, $E$, vs. the reference. One generally selects conditions such that $E$ tracks $E_{\text {appl }}$ faithfully enough for valid application of theory.

Normally, one desires that $E_{\text {appl }}$ (and, therefore, also $E$ ) be taken through a waveform (such as a step or cyclic sweep). This is achieved by varying inputs of the potentiostat with time according to the desired waveform. Chapter 16 covers the details.

[^33]Many modern potentiostats, including practically all routine instruments now found in electrochemical laboratories, are fully integrated and automated. Computers oversee all operations, including management of the cell, waveform generation, data recording, and presentation of results. You should use an instrument of this kind for the experiments suggested below.

### 1.9.2 Background Processes in Actual Cells

In our zeal to investigate the properties of a particular species, we sometimes neglect thorough study of the properties of the blank electrolyte (the identical solution with the species of interest omitted). This is usually just the solvent and supporting electrolyte, e.g., deaerated aqueous 1 M KCl or buffer solution. As described in Sections 1.1.7(b) and 1.6.4(c), the current measured in this blank electrolyte solution informs the experimenter of the anodic and cathodic potential limits and the magnitude of the charging current. This measurement is also critically important in identifying unexpected faradaic currents resulting from impurities in the supporting electrolyte and solvent. If not identified (and eliminated, if possible), these currents may be mistaken for signatures of the redox process of interest, leading to erroneous conclusions.

One can study background processes for many different electrode/electrolyte combinations. A simple experiment is to use an inexpensive commercial glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode with a diameter of $1-3 \mathrm{~mm}$ as the working electrode. The GC electrode should be placed into a deaerated 0.1 M KCl solution together with a Pt counter electrode and a commercial $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ reference electrode. Deaeration is easily achieved by bubbling the solution with nitrogen for a few minutes and then maintaining a nitrogen atmosphere over the solution in the cell. The counter electrode should have an area significantly larger than that of the working electrode. Typically, Pt foil or mesh is used, but commercial Pt counter electrodes are also readily available. For homemade Pt counter electrodes, it is important to make sure that any non-Pt electrical connections to the electrode are not exposed to the solution, as these may readily oxidize and contaminate the solution (e.g., Cu wire oxidation).

After constructing the cell and connecting the potentiostat leads, perform a cyclic voltammetric experiment in the blank electrolyte by scanning the potential at $0.1 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{s}$ over a potential range where the electrode behaves nearly as an IPE. A safe range is between -0.5 and 0.5 V vs. $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$. Plot the cyclic voltammogram and determine the value of $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ for the GC electrode $/ 0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KCl}$ interface from the steady-state charging current. Do not expect your voltammograms in blank solutions to be as ideal looking as Figure 1.6.9c; most common electrode/electrolyte interfaces do not behave as an IPE over large potential ranges. Explore how far positive and negative the GC electrode potential can be scanned before significant currents arise, marking the potential window for the system.

Carry out a potential step experiment to determine $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ in your blank solution, but be sure to keep $E$ in the IPE-like zone. Plot $\ln i$ vs. t, where $t$ is measured from the step edge. Your instrument might be able to make this plot for you, but if not, just export the data and make the plot yourself with a spreadsheet. You should be able to obtain the cell time constant from the slope and $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ from the intercept. From these measurements, estimate how fast one can charge the GC/0.1 M KCl interface. Investigate the effects of order-of-magnitude changes of electrolyte concentration on $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$. If you have additional working electrodes of much different area, consider using them to study the effect of area on $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$.

While the above experiments may appear elementary, they are important for evaluating the available potential range over which useful electrochemical measurements can be made, as well as the time constant of the cell under study. Experienced electrochemists will always make these background measurements when beginning to study a new system to ensure that background
processes and cell properties do not interfere with or limit the intended measurement with the species of interest.

### 1.9.3 Further Work with Simple RC Networks

To explore a wider range of time scales, you can investigate the responses of resistor-capacitor networks connected to the potentiostat in place of a real cell. The network in Figure 1.9.1 mimics an IPE, because the working electrode exhibits only the double-layer capacitance, $C_{\mathrm{d}}$. The solution resistance is divided into compensated and uncompensated values, $R_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{u}}$, as discussed in Section 1.5.4.

RC networks that are built as substitutes for real cells are typically called dummy cells. The three-element dummy cell in Figure 1.9.1 provides a good model for double-layer charging and is useful both as a teaching tool and for testing the transient characteristics of potentiostats.

Construct a network like that in Figure 1.9.1 using an electronics breadboard to readily connect the two resistors and a capacitor in series. A useful first set of components is $C_{\mathrm{d}}=10 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, $R_{\mathrm{u}}=1 \mathrm{k} \Omega, R_{\mathrm{c}}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$. This combination gives a cell time constant of 10 ms , so transient double-layer charging should take place in less than 50 ms . The leads from the potentiostat should be connected to the circuit as noted in the diagram.

Using the automated user interface for the potentiostat, set the instrument to perform a potential step experiment from $E_{1}=-0.5 \mathrm{~V}$ to $E_{2}=-1.5 \mathrm{~V} .^{60}$ Use a step duration of $10 R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$. As in the case with the real cell, plot $\ln i$ vs. $t$ (with $t$ measured from the step edge) and obtain the cell time constant from the slope and $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ from the intercept. Test the agreement between your experimental values of $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ against those used to construct the dummy cell.

Investigate the effects of varying $E_{1}, \Delta E=E_{2}-E_{1}, R_{\mathrm{c}}, R_{\mathrm{u}}$, and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$, including changes over orders of magnitude for the latter three parameters. When using smaller values for $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$, you may find that the $\ln i$ vs. $t$ plot becomes nonlinear at very short times due to the internal filters and output limitations of the potentiostat that you are using. Estimate the time required for the potentiostat to establish $E_{\text {appl }}$ between the working and reference electrodes.

Perform a cyclic voltammetry (triangular wave) experiment between +0.5 and -0.5 V on the original three-element network to see if the response resembles that in Figure 1.6.9c. Using the steady-state charging current, determine the value of $C_{d}$ and see how closely it matches the value of the capacitor in your circuit. Next, vary the scan rate over at least an order of magnitude and observe the dependence of the charging current on $v$. You should observe that the steady-state charging current increases linearly with scan rate. This behavior is generally seen in real electrochemical systems.

Electrochemical research groups often find dummy cells helpful for testing experimental equipment and arrangements. A common application is to calibrate the $i / E$ response of the potentiostat and to check for nonzero instrumentation offsets in either $E$ or $i$.
