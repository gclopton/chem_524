### 1.6.1 The Ideally Polarizable Electrode

No charge transfer can occur across the metal/solution interface at an IPE (Section 1.2.2), regardless of the potential imposed by an outside source of voltage. While no real electrode can behave as an IPE over the whole available potential range, some electrode/solution systems can approach ideal polarizability over limited ranges. For example, a mercury electrode in contact with a deaerated potassium chloride/potassium hydroxide solution approaches the behavior of an IPE in a window about 2 V wide. At sufficiently positive potentials, the mercury can oxidize:

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{Hg}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 e \quad(\text { near }+0.25 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE}) \tag{1.6.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

and at very negative potentials $\mathrm{K}^{+}$can be reduced:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{K}^{+}+e \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Hg}} \mathrm{~K}(\mathrm{Hg}) \quad(\text { near }-2.1 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE}) \tag{1.6.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

These are the electrode reactions that define the background limits in this system. In the potential range between these processes, charge-transfer reactions are not significant. Even though the reduction of water,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \tag{1.6.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

is thermodynamically possible over much of that range, it occurs at a very low rate at a mercury surface, unless quite negative potentials are applied. The only faradaic current flowing in this region is due to charge-transfer reactions of trace impurities (e.g., metal ions, oxygen, and organic species), and this current is quite small in clean systems. Another electrode that behaves as an IPE is a gold surface hosting an adsorbed self-assembled monolayer of alkane thiol (Section 17.1).

### 1.6.2 Capacitance and Charge at an Electrode

Since charge cannot cross the IPE interface when the potential is changed, the behavior of the electrode/solution interface is analogous to that of a capacitor, an electrical circuit element

composed of two metal sheets separated by a dielectric (an insulating material; Figure 1.6.1a). Its behavior is governed by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{q}{E}=C \tag{1.6.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $q$ is the charge stored on the capacitor (in coulombs, C ), $E$ is the potential difference across the capacitor (in volts, V ), and $C$ is the capacitance (in farads, F ). When $E$ is applied, charge will accumulate on the metal plates of the capacitor until $q$ satisfies (1.6.4). For example, if a $2-\mathrm{V}$ battery is placed across a $10-\mu \mathrm{F}$ capacitor, current will flow until $20 \mu \mathrm{C}$ has accumulated. The charge consists of an excess of electrons on one plate and a deficiency of electrons on the other (Figure 1.6.1b). During this process, a transient current (called a charging current) flows in the external circuit connecting the two plates. Its magnitude depends on the resistance in the circuit (Section 1.6.4).

The electrode/solution interface has been shown experimentally to behave like a capacitor, and a model of the interfacial region somewhat resembling a capacitor can be given. At any potential, there will exist a charge on the electrode, $q^{\mathrm{M}}$, and a charge in the solution, $q^{\mathrm{S}}$ (Figure 1.6.2). Whether the charge on the electrode is negative or positive with respect to the solution depends on the potential across the interface and the composition of the solution. At all times, however, $q^{\mathrm{M}}=-q^{\mathrm{S}}$ (Section 2.2.2). ${ }^{42}$ The charge on the electrode, $q^{\mathrm{M}}$, represents an excess or deficiency of electrons and resides in a very thin layer at the electrode surface ( $<1 \mathrm{~nm}$ in the case of a metal electrode). The charge in solution, $q^{\mathrm{S}}$, is made up of an excess of either cations or anions in the vicinity of the electrode surface. The charges $q^{\mathrm{M}}$ and $q^{\mathrm{S}}$ are often divided by the electrode area, $A$, and expressed as charge densities, e.g., $\sigma^{\mathrm{M}}=q^{\mathrm{M}} / A$, usually given in $\mu \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. The whole array of charged species and oriented dipoles existing at the electrode/solution interface is called the electrical double layer (although its structure may be more complex than two charged layers, as we will see next).

At a given potential, the electrode/solution interface is characterized by a double-layer capacitance, $C_{\mathrm{d}}$, typically in the range of $10-40 \mu \mathrm{~F} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. However, unlike real capacitors, whose capacitances are independent of the voltage across them, an electrochemical double layer typically has a $C_{d}$ that depends on potential. ${ }^{43}$

### 1.6.3 Brief Description of the Electrical Double Layer

The solution side of the double layer is itself understood to comprise layers. That closest to the electrode, the inner layer, contains solvent molecules and sometimes other species (ions

[^24]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-43.jpg?height=555&width=1081&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=193)

A more quantitative representation of this profile is shown in Figure 14.3.6.

or molecules) that are said to be specifically adsorbed (Figure 1.6.3a). This inner layer is also called the compact, Helmholtz, or Stern layer. The locus of the electrical centers of specifically adsorbed ions), at a distance $x_{1}$, is called the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). The total charge density in this inner layer is $\sigma^{1}\left(\mu \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$. Solvated ions cannot approach the metal as closely as $x_{1}$, but only to $x_{2}$, called the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). The interaction of the solvated ions with the charged metal involves only long-range electrostatic forces, which are essentially
independent of the chemical properties of the ions. These ions are said to be nonspecifically adsorbed. Because of thermal agitation (i.e., Brownian motion), the nonspecifically adsorbed ions are distributed in a three-dimensional region called the diffuse layer, which extends from the OHP into the bulk of the solution. ${ }^{44}$ The excess charge density in the diffuse layer is $\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}$; hence, the total excess charge density on the solution side of the double layer, $\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}$, is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}=\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}+\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}=-\sigma^{\mathrm{M}} \tag{1.6.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The thickness of the diffuse layer depends on the total ionic concentration in the solution. For concentrations greater than $10^{-2} \mathrm{M}$, it is less than $\sim 10 \mathrm{~nm}$. The potential profile across the double-layer region is shown in Figure 1.6.3b. Adsorption and double-layer structure are considered in much greater detail in Chapter 14.

The structure of the double layer can affect the rates of faradaic processes (Section 14.7). Consider an electroactive species that is not specifically adsorbed. This species can approach the electrode only to the OHP, and the potential it experiences there, $\phi_{2}$, differs from the potential in bulk solution, $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$, by the potential drop across the diffuse layer, $\phi_{2}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$. For example, $\phi_{2}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ in 0.1 M NaF is -0.021 V at $E=-0.55 \mathrm{~V}$ vs. SCE, but is somewhat larger in magnitude at more negative and more positive potentials. One can often neglect double-layer effects in considering electrode reactions, but at other times they must be taken into account. 45,46

One usually cannot neglect the existence of the double-layer capacitance or the presence of a charging current in electrochemical experiments. Indeed, we will see in the next section that double-layer charging is central to the establishment of potential differences in cells and to the control of potential.

### 1.6.4 Double-Layer Capacitance and Charging Current

Consider a two-electrode cell consisting of an IPE paired with a reference electrode that can pass modest currents without significant change of composition or potential. We can approximate such a system with a mercury electrode in a KCl solution contacted by an SCE. This cell, $\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$/SCE, can be modeled by an electrical circuit with a resistor, $R_{\mathrm{s}}$, representing the solution resistance and a capacitor, $C_{\mathrm{d}}$, representing the double layer at the $\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ interface (Figure 1.6.4). ${ }^{47,48}$

Information about an electrochemical system is often gained by applying an electrical perturbation and observing the response. In later chapters, we will encounter such experiments in

[^25]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-45.jpg?height=612&width=1298&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=197)
Figure 1.6.4 Left: Two-electrode cell with an ideally polarizable mercury drop electrode and an SCE. Right: Representation of the cell in terms of linear circuit elements.

many forms. It is worthwhile now to consider the response of an IPE to two common electrical perturbations: the potential step and the potential sweep. ${ }^{49}$

## (a) Potential (or Voltage) Step

The treatment of a voltage step at the IPE is the familiar RC-circuit problem (Figure 1.6.5). Suppose the network of $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ initially has no voltage across it, so that the capacitor is uncharged and there is no current through the resistor. The behavior of the current, $i$, with time, $t$, when applying a step of magnitude $E$, is



> [!Equation]
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> i=\frac{E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.6}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 



This equation is derived from (1.6.4), which can be written in terms of the voltage across the double-layer capacitor, $E_{\mathrm{C}}$ as

$$
\begin{equation*}
q=C_{\mathrm{d}} E_{\mathrm{C}} \tag{1.6.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

At $t>0$, the sum of the voltages, $E_{\mathrm{R}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{C}}$, across the resistor and the capacitor, respectively, must equal the applied step; hence,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{\mathrm{R}}+E_{\mathrm{C}}=i R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Recognizing that $i=d q / d t$, we obtain, with rearrangement,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d q}{d t}=\frac{-q}{R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}+\frac{E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} \tag{1.6.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The solution of (1.6.9) is

> q=E C_{\mathrm{d}}\left[1-e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}\right] \tag{1.6.10}
> \end{equation*}

By differentiating (1.6.10), one obtains (1.6.6).
Thus, a potential step produces an exponentially decaying charging current having a time constant, $\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$ (Figure 1.6.6). The current drops to $37 \%$ of its initial value at $t=\tau$, and to $5 \%$ of its initial value at $t=3 \tau$. If $R_{\mathrm{s}}=1 \Omega$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}=20 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, for example, then $\tau=20 \mu \mathrm{~s}$ and double-layer charging is $95 \%$ complete in $60 \mu \mathrm{~s}$.

The treatment for a real electrochemical cell is somewhat more complicated, because the working electrode's potential, $E$, is defined arbitrarily by the choice of the reference electrode. Applying a zero voltage across the cell or a zero potential $v s$. the reference electrode does not mean that the working electrode becomes uncharged. ${ }^{50}$ That happens when the working electrode is at $E_{\mathrm{z}}$, the potential of zero charge (PZC), which is defined by the nature of the electrode and solution. The voltage across $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ at any moment is $E-E_{\mathrm{z}}$, and the charge on the electrode is ${ }^{51}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
q=C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(E-E_{\mathrm{z}}\right) \tag{1.6.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

Also, we dealt in the treatment above only with the magnitude of the step and did not worry about its direction or about the sign of the current. We will fix these points in the following treatment.

[^27]Now suppose that we have a three-electrode cell, as in Section 1.5.3. A potentiostat continuously measures and controls $E_{\text {appl }}$, the voltage applied at the working electrode vs. the reference electrode (perhaps an SCE). At $t=0, E_{\text {appl }}$ is abruptly changed from one value, $E_{1}$, to another, $E_{2}$. We assume that the double layer at the working electrode is fully charged before the step, so that no current flows through the solution. Accordingly, there is no ohmic drop in the solution, and the potential of the working electrode is also $E_{1}$. After $t=0$, when $E_{\text {appl }}$ becomes $E_{2}$, the potential of the working electrode is driven to change in the same direction. The charge on $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ must change, too, and a current must flow through the solution resistance. From (1.5.2), the potential of the working electrode at any moment is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{2}+i R_{\mathrm{u}} \tag{1.6.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ is the uncompensated resistance (Section 1.5.4). ${ }^{52}$ Now, let us subtract $E_{\mathrm{z}}$ from both sides, then multiply by $C_{\mathrm{d}}$.

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(E-E_{\mathrm{z}}\right)=C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(E_{2}-E_{\mathrm{z}}\right)+i R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}} \tag{1.6.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

From (1.6.11), we recognize the left side as $q$, the charge on the working electrode at any moment, and we see that the first term on the right is $q_{2}$, the double-layer charge on the working electrode when its potential arrives at the step potential, $E_{2}$. Also, we know that $i=-d q / d t$ (given the current convention), so by substitution and rearrangement we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d q}{d t}=-\frac{q}{R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}+\frac{q_{2}}{R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

which has the same form as (1.6.9). The solution is, however, not a form of (1.6.10), because we cannot assume the double layer at the working electrode to be uncharged at $t=0$. Indeed, we have already assumed that it was equilibrated at $E_{1}$ before the step, so the initial charge on the double layer would be

$$
\begin{equation*}
q_{1}=C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(E_{1}-E_{\mathrm{z}}\right) \tag{1.6.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Problem A.9, the reader can show that the solution to (1.6.14) with that initial condition is

$$
\begin{equation*}
q=q_{2}-\left(q_{2}-q_{1}\right) e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}=q_{2}-C_{\mathrm{d}} \Delta E e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have recognized $q_{2}-q_{1}$ as $C_{\mathrm{d}} \Delta E$, with $\Delta E=E_{2}-E_{1}$.
The charging current is then derived from (1.6.16) as $-d q / d t .{ }^{53}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=-\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{u}}} e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

By substitution into (1.6.12), we find the potential of the working electrode to be

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{2}-\Delta E e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} \tag{1.6.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 1.6.7 shows behavior typical of a hanging Hg drop in $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KCl} \nu s$. an SCE (i.e., in a three-electrode version of the cell in Figure 1.6.4). There are three noteworthy points:

1) Any change of potential at an electrode is inseparable from a concomitant charging of the double layer at that electrode. Indeed, interfacial charging is the means by which the potential of a conducting phase is established, as we will see in greater detail in Chapter 2.
2) The potential at the working electrode does not immediately follow $E_{\text {appl }}$. It takes time to charge the double layer at the working electrode-at least several times $R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$.
[^28]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-48.jpg?height=661&width=1261&top_left_y=238&top_left_x=181)

(b) Double-layer charge on the working electrode: $q_{1}=-8 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=-28 \mu \mathrm{C}$. (c) $E$ (solid curve) and $E_{\text {appl }}$ (points) vs. the reference.

3) The current passed in the charging process decays exponentially after the step is applied, but it can be quite large at first. In the system relating to Figure 1.6.7, the initial charging current is 1 A , and the voltage drop across the uncompensated resistance at $t=0$ is 1 V , the entirety of the applied step. These are big effects.

## (b) Linear Potential Sweep (or Voltage Ramp)

In many electrochemical experiments, one desires that $E_{\text {appl }}$ start at some initial value, $E_{1}$, then change linearly with time at a sweep rate (or scan rate), $\nu$ (in $\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{s}$ ), until a final value, $E_{2}$, is reached (Figure 1.6.8a). ${ }^{54}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{appl}}=E_{1}-v t \tag{1.6.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

We assume that the double layer at the working electrode is fully charged at $E_{1}$ before the sweep starts, so that there is no current flow through the solution, and the potential of the working electrode is $E_{1}$. At $t=0$, the sweep begins. Because the potential at the working electrode is continuously changing, the charge on the double layer must be continuously altered, too. A charging current must flow through the cell, and it will produce a voltage drop in solution. The potential of the working electrode is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{1}-v t+i R_{\mathrm{u}} \tag{1.6.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

The same procedures used to transform (1.6.12) into (1.6.14) allow (1.6.20) to become

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d q}{d t}=-\frac{q}{R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}+\frac{q_{1}}{R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}-\frac{v t}{R_{\mathrm{u}}} \tag{1.6.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $q_{1}$ is the initial charge on the double layer at the working electrode, given by (1.6.15).

[^29]The solution to this differential equation is

$$
\begin{equation*}
q=q_{1}-v t C_{\mathrm{d}}+v R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}^{2}\left(1-e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}\right) \tag{1.6.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

and the current is found as $-d q / d t$, or


> [!Equation]
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation*}
> i= \pm v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-t / R_{\mathrm{u}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}\right) \quad(+ \text { for neg. scan, }- \text { for pos. scan }) \tag{1.6.23}
> \end{equation*}
> $$
> 


The development through (1.6.22) is for a negative-going scan and would lead to a positive sign before $v$ in (1.6.23). For a positive-going scan, the signs before $v$ would be reversed in (1.6.20)-(1.6.22). The final result is given explicitly for both directions in (1.6.23).

For a negative-going scan, the current increases from zero after the scan starts. Over several cell time constants, it attains a steady value, $\nu C_{\mathrm{d}}$ (Figure 1.6.8b), which can be used to estimate $C_{\mathrm{d}}$.

Alternatively, one can let $E_{\text {appl }}$ follow a triangular wave (i.e., a voltage ramp whose sweep direction reverses at some potential, $E_{\lambda}$, as in Figure 1.6.9a). For the case of a negative-going forward scan, the triangular wave is expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
E_{\text {appl }}=E_{1}-v t & 0 \leq t \leq\left|E_{\lambda}-E_{1}\right| / v \\
E_{\text {appl }}=E_{\lambda}+v t & t>\left|E_{\lambda}-E_{1}\right| / v \tag{1.6.25}
\end{array}
$$

The steady-state current changes from $\nu C_{\mathrm{d}}$ during the forward scan to $-\nu C_{\mathrm{d}}$ during the reverse scan. The result for a system with constant $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ is shown in Figure 1.6.9 for the case of a negative-going initial scan.

## (c) Charging Current in Electrochemical Measurements

We have taken care with charging current here, because a great fraction of electrochemical experimentation involves it. Most strategies are based on changes, over time, of potential, interfacial structure, or even electrode area; consequently, a charging current generally exists

and contributes to a background against which faradaic currents are observed. ${ }^{55}$ The charging current frequently interferes with measurements of faradaic currents. When the electroactive species are present at low concentrations (e.g., as in trace analysis), the charging current can be much larger than any faradaic current of interest and commonly defines detection limits. In later chapters, we will return repeatedly to this issue and to strategies for dealing with it.

Still, one must not regard charging current as simply a background concern. It is integral to the control of potential in electrochemical systems, so it is essential to experimental design and execution. Moreover, it provides access to the surface charge on the electrode and to the interfacial capacitance, which are informative about interfacial structure. In some work, the charging current is the main concern, providing access to the information sought about a system.

## (d) A Last Word about $E_{\text {appl }}$

In Sections 1.5 and 1.6, we have focused on the distinction between the potential of the working electrode, $E$, and the voltage applied externally to the working electrode, $E_{\text {appl }}$, vs. the reference. These two quantities differ by the uncompensated ohmic drop, $i R_{\mathrm{u}}$.

[^30]In most electrochemical experiments, one desires to control the potential of the working electrode, and $E_{\text {appl }}$ is the vehicle of control. At every moment, it is the target for $E$. If $E_{\text {appl }}$ is programmed as a step or a sweep, for example, one desires that the working electrode follow faithfully enough for theoretical treatments of the experiment to be valid. We have seen that $E$ does not follow $E_{\text {appl }}$ strictly. How well it follows depends on the cell time constant and the magnitude of the uncompensated ohmic drop, so one must be attentive to these matters.

Fortunately, it is often practical to establish experimental conditions under which $E$ does follow $E_{\text {appl }}$ well enough. This will be true when

- The cell time constant can be made short compared to the time scale ${ }^{56}$ of the experiment.
- The uncompensated ohmic drop is small.

Both of these conditions can usually be satisfied if the solution is sufficiently conductive and the working electrode area is small enough. Depending on the system, it may be necessary to use a three-electrode cell and employ electronic compensation of resistance (Section 16.7.3).

Because $E$ is practically the same as $E_{\text {appl }}$ in most experimental work, experienced practitioners rarely distinguish these quantities as they speak and write. They simply say, for example, that they have taken $E$ (rather than $E_{\text {appl }}$ ) through a step program or a triangular wave. They depict the step or the sweep ideally, even though they well understand the nonideality at a step edge or at the turning point of a sweep. In published figures, such as voltammograms, they will show the potential axis as $E$, even though the instruments that produce the figures actually use $E_{\text {appl }}$.

In the rest of this book, we will follow the same practice. Further reference will rarely be made to $E_{\text {appl }}$. Unless a cautionary point is being made, we will just assume that we can control $E$ ideally enough, even as we take it through complex programs. We will just have to remain on the lookout for effects of uncompensated ohmic drop in recorded results.
