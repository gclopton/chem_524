# 1.7 Organization of this Book

This book has been structured to support options for teachers and students as they follow their own paths into the subject. Figure 1.7.1 illustrates possibilities.

The left column comprehends the essential core, presented in the first seven chapters. It is best to cover this material in sequence, because core ideas and treatments are generally constructed on preceding concepts.

In the right column, the teacher and student gain extensive flexibility to tailor further study according to interests and available time. The dots by the individual chapters and the dashed arrows signal that the chapters are, for the most part, independently selectable after prior study through Chapter 7. Even though the book is built as a complete story, with all chapters designed to be addressed in sequence (signified by the solid arrows), a reader can be effective by covering a few chapters in the right column.

The final group also allows for selective study; however, Chapters 17-21 are generally built on knowledge from the Advanced Fundamentals group (Chapters 13-16).

There are also appendices providing support for students as they work through this text. The mathematical techniques in Appendix A are extensively employed in Chapters 5-13. It will ease

the reader's progress to have worked through, or at least to have reviewed, Appendix A before starting Chapter 5. Appendix B is an introduction to digital simulation methods, which are widely used to address complex problems of contemporary interest. The need for simulation will come up throughout the book, beginning in Chapter 5. Appendix C is a set of reference tables useful for the end-of-chapter problems and for daily activity.
