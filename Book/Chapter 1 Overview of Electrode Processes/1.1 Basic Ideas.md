### 1.1.1 Electrochemical Cells and Reactions

In electrochemical systems, one is concerned with the processes and factors affecting the transport of charge across interfaces between adjacent chemical phases, most commonly between an electronic conductor (an electrode) and an ionic conductor (an electrolyte). Throughout this book, we will focus on the electrode/electrolyte interface and the events that occur there when an electric potential is applied and current passes.

Charge is transported through an electrode by the movement of electrons (and sometimes by "holes" in semiconductor electrodes). In an electrolyte, charge is carried by the movement of ions. ${ }^{1}$ At the interface between an electrode and an electrolyte, the passage of charge requires that these distinct conduction modes be linked through an electrode reaction, causing electrons to be consumed or produced at the electrode and ions to be produced or consumed in the electrolyte. Examples include:

a) Plating of copper from an aqueous solution,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu} \tag{1.1.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

b) Production of hydrogen gas from alkaline water at a platinum electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \tag{1.1.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

c) Generation of the nitrobenzene radical anion in acetonitrile at a gold electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{PhNO}_{2}+e \rightarrow \mathrm{PhNO}_{2} \bullet \tag{1.1.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

d) De-intercalation of lithium ion from a lithium cobalt oxide electrode in a lithium-ion battery, leaving an excess electron on the electrode to be used in an external circuit,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{LiCoO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Li}_{1-x} \mathrm{CoO}_{2}+x \mathrm{Li}^{+}+x e \tag{1.1.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

e) Oxidation of stable ruthenium(II) complexes in water solution at a gold electrode, ${ }^{2}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ru}(\mathrm{bpy})_{3}^{2+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ru}(\mathrm{bpy})_{3}^{3+}+e \tag{1.1.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Typical electrode materials include solid metals (e.g., Pt, Au), liquid metals (e.g., Hg, amalgams), carbon (e.g., graphite, graphene, glassy carbon), and semiconductors (indium-tin oxide, Si, GaAs, CdS). The most common electrolytes are liquid solutions containing ionic species, such as, $\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, tetraalkylammonium, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, or $\mathrm{BF}_{4}^{-}$in water or a nonaqueous solvent. To be useful in an electrochemical cell, the solvent-electrolyte system must be of sufficiently low resistance (i.e., sufficiently conductive) for the electrochemical experiment envisioned. Less conventional electrolytes include fused salts (e.g., molten $\mathrm{NaCl}-\mathrm{KCl}$ eutectic) and ionically conductive polymers (e.g., Nafion, polyethylene oxide- $\mathrm{LiClO}_{4}$ ). Solid electrolytes also exist (e.g., sodium $\beta$-alumina, in which charge is carried by mobile sodium ions moving between aluminum oxide sheets).

It is natural to think about events at a single interface, but we will find that one cannot deal experimentally with an isolated boundary. Instead, one must study collections of interfaces called electrochemical cells, which are defined most generally as two electrodes separated by at least one electrolyte phase.

There is a shorthand notation for expressing the structures of cells. For example, that pictured in Figure 1.1.1 $a$ is written compactly as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{1.1.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

In this notation, a slash represents a phase boundary, and a comma separates two components in the same phase. ${ }^{3}$ When a gaseous phase is involved, it is written adjacent to its corresponding conducting element. For example, the cell in Figure 1.1.1 $b$ is written schematically as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{1.1.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Generally, the electrodes in a cell are not at the same electrical potential. If the two electrodes are connected by a wire, electrons can move from the more negative electrode to the more positive, so that a chemical reaction can be sustained in the cell. Electrons produced on the negative electrode by an electrode reaction proceed to the positive electrode, where they feed a different electrode reaction, consuming the electrons. The overall chemical reaction taking place in a cell is made up of the independent half-reactions describing the separate chemical changes at the two electrodes. For example, the bidirectional half-reactions for the cell in (1.1.6) are $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}$ and $\mathrm{AgCl}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. When the electrodes are connected, the reaction at zinc proceeds in the backward direction, while that at silver goes forward. Zinc dissolves and AgCl is converted to $\mathrm{Ag}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The net result is
$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{AgCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \tag{1.1.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

Processes 1.1.1-1.1.5 are all half-reactions. None can happen alone. Each must be coupled in a cell that includes a second interface with another half-reaction proceeding in the opposite direction.

### 1.1.2 Interfacial Potential Differences and Cell Potential

We will find in Chapter 2 that a transition in electric potential can generally be expected in crossing from one conducting phase to another. Moreover, it usually occurs in a narrow zone right at the interface. Thus, the electric potential changes in a stairstep fashion as one proceeds from one electrode, through the intervening conducting phases, to the other electrode. The situation is as depicted in Figure 1.1.2.

A high-impedance voltmeter enables one to measure a difference in electrical potential between the electrodes in a complete cell without perturbing the cell by drawing an appreciable current from it. This cell potential **(in volts (V), where $1 \mathrm{~V}=1$ joule/coulomb (J/C))** expresses the energy available to drive charge externally between the electrodes and to do electrical work outside the cell. It is the sum of the individual interfacial potential differences encountered on the electrical path inside the cell from one electrode to another (shown as $E$ in Figure 1.1.2).

The potential difference between the electrodes is not merely to be observed in the manner just discussed. It can also be deliberately altered by connecting a power supply across the cell. As the applied voltage is adjusted, one can generally expect changes in the individual interfacial potential differences, especially at the electrode/electrolyte boundaries. Normally, the imposed voltage will differ from the open-circuit cell potential, and the cell will respond by drawing current from the power supply. By changing the imposed voltage, it is practical to drive the

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-04.jpg?height=628&width=1015&top_left_y=1431&top_left_x=191)

The Cu and $\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}$ represent contacts made to the cell in Figure 1.1.1a using copper wire. A cell potential can be measured only between two like phases. The AgCl is not in the electrical path because it is porous, and the electrolyte has direct access to the Ag . The AgCl is, however, a critical component of the half reaction, so it is included in the representation of the cell.

current in either direction. We will shortly be discussing the magnitude and chemical effects of the current.

A sharp transition in potential at a phase boundary implies that a high electric field exists there. One can expect it to influence the behavior of charge carriers (electrons or ions) in the interfacial region. More important, a potential difference at an interface affects the relative energies of electrons on opposite sides of the boundary; hence, it can determine the direction and the rate of electron transfer. Accordingly, the measurement and control of potential differences in a cell are among the most important aspects of experimental electrochemistry.

### 1.1.3 Reference Electrodes and Control of Potential at a Working Electrode

Even though it is always necessary to employ whole cells in electrochemical investigations, one's interest is usually in the behavior at only one of the electrodes, called the working electrode. ${ }^{4}$ To focus on it, one can standardize the other half of the cell by using an electrode (called a reference electrode) that exhibits a reproducible, invariant potential difference at its electrode/electrolyte boundary. If one can build a cell in which a working electrode is paired with a well-behaved reference electrode, then any change in the cell potential must occur at the working electrode.

The key to such a reference electrode is to maintain a known, constant composition. If all participants in a half-reaction are present at an electrode/electrolyte interface (including both redox forms (e.g., both AgCl and Ag or both $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ )), the interfacial potential difference turns out to be linked to the activities of those species near the electrode. The Nernst equation, familiar from introductory chemistry, describes the behavior quantitatively (Section 2.1.6). By constructing a reference electrode of reproducible composition, one obtains a reproducible potential difference at the reference interface.

It is also important that the interfacial potential difference at the reference electrode not change when current passes through the cell and that the reference side of the cell not suffer contamination from the working side. We will soon see how these issues can be addressed. The design, construction, and use of reference electrodes make up a substantial topic of their own (Sections 2.1.8 and 2.5), but it should not divert us now. The present goal is just to introduce the concept of a reference electrode and to identify some common types.

The internationally accepted primary reference is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), or normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which has all components at unit activity at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ : ${ }^{6}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}_{2}(a=1) / \mathrm{H}^{+}(a=1, \text { aqueous }) \tag{1.1.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since the NHE is not convenient from an experimental standpoint, ${ }^{7}$ potentials are measured and quoted with respect to other reference electrodes. An important historic reference is the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), which is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{KCl} \text { (saturated in water) } \tag{1.1.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

Its potential at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 0.244 V vs. NHE .

[^2]A more common reference, is the silver/silver chloride electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{KCl} \text { (saturated in water) } \tag{1.1.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

with a potential at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of 0.197 V vs. NHE. It is common to see potentials identified in the literature as "vs. $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ " when this electrode is used.

When a cell potential is simply observed using a high-impedance voltmeter, no significant current is allowed to pass in the external circuit between the electrodes. In that situation, the working electrode potential would change only if the composition at the working electrode were to be altered, perhaps because of a pH change or because new species were added to the surrounding solution.

As mentioned above, it is also possible to shift the potential of the working electrode vs. the reference by connecting a power supply to these two electrodes, causing the cell potential to adopt the power supply's output voltage. Ideally, any change in the cell potential from that observed without connection to the power supply would show up at the working electrode, because the reference electrode is built to maintain a constant interfacial potential difference. ${ }^{8}$ In this way, we might achieve the ability to control the working electrode's potential arbitrarily. In sections below, we will revisit that topic in detail.

### 1.1.4 Potential as an Expression of Electron Energy

We say in electrochemistry that we observe or control the potential of the working electrode with respect to the reference, which is equivalent to observing or controlling the energy of the transferable electrons on the working electrode, relative to electronic states in the electrolyte $(1,2)$ (Section 2.2.5). By driving the working electrode to more negative potentials, the energies of its electrons are raised. Very significant changes in energy can be achieved, because the potential can often be shifted over a range of several volts. For each volt, the energy of each electron on the working electrode changes by one electron-volt $(1 \mathrm{eV}),{ }^{9}$ which is 96.5 kJ per mole of electrons. This is a sizable change in energy-comparable to the activation energies or overall energy changes involved in many chemical reactions-comparable, as well, to the spacings between orbitals involved in chemical bonding.

The electrons on the electrode can reach a level high enough to transfer into vacant electronic states on species in the electrolyte. In that case, a flow of electrons from electrode to solution (a reduction current) occurs (Figure 1.1.3a). Similarly, the energy of the electrons can be lowered by imposing a more positive potential, and at some point, electrons on molecules or ions in the electrolyte will find a more favorable energy on the electrode and can transfer there. Their flow, from solution to electrode, is an oxidation current (Figure 1.1.3b). The critical potentials at which these processes occur are often related to the standard potentials, $E^{0}$, for the specific half-reactions in the system. We will have much more to say about standard potentials, especially in Chapter 2.

### 1.1.5 Current as an Expression of Reaction Rate

When the potential of the working electrode vs. the reference is varied by means of an external power supply, a current can flow in the external circuit, because electrons cross the

[^3]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-07.jpg?height=1309&width=1251&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=199)
_Figure 1.1.3_ Representation of (a) reduction and (b) oxidation of a species, A, in solution. The molecular orbitals (MO) shown for species A are the highest occupied MO and the lowest vacant MO . For simple one-electron reactions, these correspond in an approximate way to the $E^{0}$ values of the $\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{A}^{-}$and $\mathrm{A}^{+} / \mathrm{A}$ couples, respectively. The illustrated system could represent an aromatic hydrocarbon like 9,10-diphenylanthracene in an aprotic solvent like acetonitrile at a platinum electrode.

electrode/solution interfaces as reactions occur. The number of electrons is related stoichiometrically to the amounts of reactant consumed and product generated. If an electrode reaction consumes or produces $n$ electrons for each reactant (e.g., $2 e$ for the oxidation of Zn ), then $n$ moles of electrons must flow in the external circuit for every mole of electroreactant transformed. The total charge, $Q$, on those electrons is

$$
\begin{equation*}
Q(\text { coulombs })=n F(\text { coulombs } / \text { mol electrolyzed }) \times N(\text { mol electrolyzed }) \tag{1.1.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $F$ (the Faraday constant) is the charge on a mole of electrons, $96,485.3 \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}$. Equation (1.1.12) is known as Faraday's law. The passage of 96,485.3 C causes consumption of 1 mole of reactant and production of 1 mole of product in a simple one-electron reaction. ${ }^{10}$

[^4]The current, expressed in amperes (A), is the rate at which the total charge is collected,

$$
\begin{align*}
& i(\text { amperes })=\frac{d Q}{d t}(\text { coulombs } / \mathrm{s})=n F \frac{d N}{d t}  \tag{1.1.13}\\
& \text { Rate }(\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{s})=\frac{d N}{d t}=\frac{i}{n F} \tag{1.1.14}
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the current is a direct measure of the rate of the reaction at the working electrode.
Interpreting the rate of an electrode reaction is often more complex than for reactions occurring in solution or in the gas phase. The latter are called homogeneous reactions because they occur everywhere within the medium at a uniform rate. In contrast, electrode processes are heterogeneous reactions, occurring only at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Their rates depend on mass transfer to the electrode and various surface effects, in addition to the usual kinetic variables. Reaction rates, $v$, for heterogeneous reactions are usually given in units of mol/s per unit area of electrode surface, $A$; i.e.,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{Rate}\left(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right)=v=\frac{i}{n F A}=\frac{j}{n F} \tag{1.1.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $j$ is the current density ( $\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ).

### 1.1.6 Magnitudes in Electrochemical Systems

It is common to characterize the scale of an electrochemical system according to the size of the working electrode, the magnitude of the current, the duration over which a current can be delivered, the timescale of an experimental perturbation, or the mass of reactant consumed or product created. Systems can be huge or tiny by any of these measures. Working electrodes can be as large as several square meters or as small as a square nanometer $\left(10^{-18} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$. Current may be in the hundreds of thousands of amperes or in the picoamperes. A current might be required to last for nanoseconds or for years, and the timescales of experimental perturbations can extend from the indefinite to nanoseconds. The use of a system may involve no consumption of material, only a few atoms, or massive amounts. In the upper range, for example, the industrial production of metallic aluminum is wholly accomplished in electrochemical cells. The global economy produces about 50 million metric tons annually. The US share of this production (but less than 5\% of the global total) still requires several percent of all US electric power production.

While this book is general in its presentation of electrochemical fundamentals, the real focus is on the experimental methodology used to measure properties of chemical systems or to investigate chemical behavior. We will be thinking about "lab-sized" cells convenient to bench-top work. They generally will not be larger than a few hundred mL , but they can be much, much smaller. Cells containing microliters are common. Indeed, cells have been made with volumes in the attoliter ( $10^{-18} \mathrm{~L}$ ) range.

In most experiments, we will seek only to probe the system, not to change its overall composition appreciably. A small working electrode is usually employed. It might be a disk (made by sealing a wire in glass and polishing a cross-section), an exposed length of wire, or a droplet. It might be as large as a few centimeters in diameter or length, but usually it is smaller, and the surface area is less than $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Much work has been done with very much smaller electrodes, e.g., with disks having diameters in the range of a few $\mu \mathrm{m}$ or even down to about 10 nm .

The equipment used to control and to observe electrochemical cells can sometimes deliver $1-10 \mathrm{~A}$, but mostly it has less capacity. "Large" currents in lab-sized cells are $10-1000 \mathrm{~mA}$. Currents at tiny working electrodes can be picoamperes ( $10^{-12} \mathrm{~A}$ ), or even smaller.

In the pictures we have drawn so far, the geometry of the electrodes has not been critical, and they might have been made roughly, perhaps of exposed wire or foil, without much regard for the surface area. As we become more sophisticated in our discussion, we will find that geometry is often very important in electrochemical systems. We will have to pay close attention to the shapes and sizes of electrodes and to their relative placement in the system.

### 1.1.7 Current-Potential Curves

A plot of the current at the working electrode vs. the potential of that electrode-a current-potential ( $i-E$ ) curve-can be quite informative about reactions occurring at the working interface. Much of this book deals with how one obtains and interprets $i-E$ curves.

Let us consider the cell in Figure 1.1.4 and discuss in a qualitative way the current-potential curve that might be obtained from it. In Section 1.3 and in later chapters, we will be more quantitative. The first step is to consider the voltage measured by the high-impedance voltmeter when the switch is left open, so that no current passes through the cell. This voltage is called the open-circuit potential of the cell. ${ }^{11}$

#### (a) Open-Circuit Potential

For some electrochemical cells, like those in Figure 1.1.1, it is possible to calculate the open-circuit potential from thermodynamic data, i.e., via the Nernst equation from the [^5]standard potentials of the half-reactions involved at both electrodes (Section 2.1.6). The key requirement is that true equilibria must be established on both sides of the cell, because each electrode engages a pair of redox forms linked by a given half-reaction (i.e., a redox couple). In Figure 1.1.1b, for example, we have $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ at one electrode and Ag and AgCl at the other. ${ }^{12}$



![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-09.jpg?height=674&width=717&top_left_y=1081&top_left_x=202)
_Figure 1.1.4_ Electrochemical cell $\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Br}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgBr} / \mathrm{Ag}$ attached to apparatus for obtaining a current-potential curve. The power supply is continuously tunable from positive to negative voltage. Switch, S, allows it to be connected or disconnected from the cell. In the depicted situation, the power supply is set to draw electrons, when the switch is closed, from the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ electrode (where Ag is converted to AgBr ) and send them to the Pt electrode (where $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is converted to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ). Arrows show the path of electron flow, which passes through ammeter, $i$, measuring the current. The high-impedance voltmeter, $V$, measures the potential difference between the two electrodes, but requires only a tiny current. External wiring is of Cu (dashed segments), so there are junctions between the Cu and the electrode materials, signified by the dots just below the voltmeter. Atmospheric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ has been removed from the cell, because it represents an interference to the processes of interest. Since the electroreduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ commonly interferes, most electrochemical cells are purged of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by bubbling with nitrogen or other means.



The cell in _Figure 1.1.4_ is different, because an overall equilibrium cannot be established. At the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ electrode, a couple is present, and the half-reaction is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{AgBr}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}+\mathrm{Br}^{-} \quad E^{0}=0.0711 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE} \tag{1.1.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since both AgBr and Ag are pure solids, their activities are unity. The activity of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$can be found from the concentration in solution; hence, the potential of this electrode (with respect to NHE) can be calculated from the Nernst equation. This electrode is at equilibrium. However, we cannot calculate a thermodynamic potential for the $\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}$electrode, because we cannot identify a pair of redox forms coupled by a given half-reaction. The controlling pair clearly is not the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$ couple, since no $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ has been introduced into the cell. Consequently, the Pt electrode, and the cell as a whole, are not at equilibrium. An equilibrium cell potential does not exist.

Even though the equilibrium potential of the cell is not available from thermodynamic data, the cell does have a potential at open circuit, and we can place it within a range, as shown below. The actual value of the open-circuit potential in this case turns out to be governed by kinetics, as discussed in Chapter 3.

Let us now consider what happens when an adjustable power supply (even a battery bridged by a potentiometer) and a microammeter are connected across the cell by closing the switch shown in _Figure 1.1.4_, and the potential of the Pt electrode is gradually made more negative with respect to the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ electrode. The latter is a ==reference electrode== because it is at equilibrium and has a fixed potential; thus, changes in the cell potential are manifested at the Pt electrode, which we can regard as the ==working electrode==. ${ }^{13}$

The first electrode reaction that occurs at the Pt is the reduction of protons,

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{1.1.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

The direction of electron flow is from the electrode to protons in solution, as in _Figure 1.1.3a_, so a reduction (cathodic) current flows.

This result is shown graphically on the right side of _Figure 1.1.5_, our first example of a current-potential curve. In the convention used in this book, cathodic currents are taken as positive, and negative potentials are plotted to the right. ${ }^{14}$ The current corresponding to

[^6]the reduction of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$rises sharply as the potential of the Pt electrode approaches $E^{0}$ for the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$ reaction ( 0 V vs. NHE or -0.07 V vs. the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ electrode). At any moment, that same current passes at the $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ reference electrode, where it causes the oxidation of Ag in the presence of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$in solution to form AgBr . The conservation of charge requires that the rate of oxidation at the Ag electrode be equal to the rate of reduction at the Pt electrode. ${ }^{15}$

When the potential of the Pt electrode is made sufficiently positive, electrons are drawn from the solution phase into the electrode, as $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$is oxidized to $\mathrm{Br}_{2}\left(\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Br}_{3}^{-}\right)$. The corresponding oxidation (anodic) current increases sharply (in the negative direction) as $E_{\mathrm{Pt}}$ approaches $E^{0}$ for the half-reaction,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Br}_{2}+2 e \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Br}^{-} \tag{1.1.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is +1.09 V vs. NHE or +1.02 V vs. $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$. As this reaction occurs (right-to-left) at the Pt electrode, AgBr in the reference electrode is reduced to Ag , and $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$dissolves into solution.

_Figure 1.1.5_ is an example of a background $i-E$ curve, depicting the behavior of a working electrode immersed in a solution containing only an electrolyte added to decrease the solution resistance (a supporting electrolyte). Background curves generally feature sharply rising currents on either side, because the corresponding reactants are present at high concentrations (e.g., $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ on the negative side and $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$on the positive side, in the case of _Figure 1.1.5_). At some extreme potential (relative to the zero-current potential), a background current becomes so great that it obscures any smaller currents from parallel electrode reactions (perhaps from species of interest added to the blank electrolyte for investigation). A ==background limit== is a potential beyond which useful information usually cannot be obtained. The ==working range== (or ==potential window==) is the region between the positive and negative background limits, where reactions other than the background processes can be studied, given the electrode material, solvent, and supporting electrolyte. In the system of Figure 1.1.5, the working range is roughly from +0.9 to +0.1 V .



![[Figure 1.15.png]]


_Figure 1.1.5_ Current-potential curve for the Pt working electrode in Pt / $\mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Br}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgBr} / \mathrm{Ag}$, showing proton reduction and bromide oxidation. Since $E_{\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}}=0.07 \mathrm{~V}$ vs. NHE, the potential axis could be converted to $E_{\mathrm{Pt}}$ vs. NHE by adding 0.07 V to each value of potential. The reader may expect the rise in reductive current to be closer to 0.0 V vs. NHE ( -0.07 V on the scale used here). Because the proton concentration is so large, the hydrogen discharge wave is enormous. On the observed current scale, one sees only the very "foot" of that wave, which is significantly positive of 0.0 V vs. NHE. This effect applies to many processes determining background limits.



The open-circuit potential (i.e., the zero-current potential) is not well defined in Figure 1.1.5. One can say only that it lies somewhere between the background limits. The value found experimentally will depend upon trace impurities in the solution (e.g., oxygen) and the previous history of the Pt electrode.

#### (c) A Change of Working Electrode


> [!Question] Title

Let us now consider the same cell, but with the Pt replaced with a mercury working electrode:

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Br}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgBr} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{1.1.19}
\end{equation*}

We still cannot calculate an open-circuit potential for the cell, because we cannot define a redox couple for the Hg electrode. Upon examining the behavior of this cell with an applied external potential, we find that the electrode reactions and the observed current-potential behavior are very different from the earlier case. The results are depicted in Figure 1.1.6, showing the current at the Hg working electrode vs. the potential of that electrode, measured with respect to the reference and then shifted to the NHE scale.

When the potential of the Hg is made negative, there is essentially no cathodic current in the region near 0.0 V , where thermodynamics predict that $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ evolution should occur. Indeed, the potential must be brought to considerably more negative values, as shown in Figure 1.1.6, before this reaction takes place. The thermodynamics have not changed, for the equilibrium potential of half-reaction 1.1.7 is independent of the metal electrode [Section 2.2.4(e)]. However, when mercury serves as the electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the reaction rate (characterized by a heterogeneous rate constant) is much lower than at Pt. Under these circumstances, the reaction does not occur at values suggested by thermodynamics. Considerably higher electron energies (corresponding to more negative potentials) must be applied to make the reaction occur at a measurable rate.

The rate constant for a heterogeneous electron-transfer reaction is a function of applied potential. Any additional potential (beyond the thermodynamic requirement) needed to drive

Figure 1.1.6 Current-potential curve for the Hg electrode in the cell $\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Br}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgBr} / \mathrm{Ag}$, showing the limiting processes: proton reduction with a large negative overpotential and mercury oxidation. The potential axis is defined through the process outlined in the caption to Figure 1.1.5.

a reaction at a certain rate is called an overpotential; thus, it is said that mercury shows "a high overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction." Chapter 15 covers this reaction in detail and provides an explanation for the behavior at mercury. As we will see in Chapter 3, an overpotential has the effect of lowering the activation barrier for an electrode reaction.

When the mercury is brought to more positive potentials, both the anodic reaction and the potential range for flow of current differ from those observed when Pt is used as the electrode. The positive background limit occurs when Hg is oxidized to $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Br}_{2}$ at a potential near 0.14 V vs. NHE ( 0.07 V vs. $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgBr}$ ), characteristic of the half-reaction

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Br}_{2}+2 e \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Hg}+2 \mathrm{Br}^{-} \tag{1.1.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

As we can surmise from these two examples, background limits vary from system to system and depend generally upon the electrode material, the solvent, and the supporting electrolyte on the working side of the cell.

#### (d) Addition of an Electroactive Solute

Let us now move beyond background curves by considering the previous cell with the addition of a small amount of $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ to the solution,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Br}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}\left(10^{-3} \mathrm{M}\right) / \mathrm{AgBr} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{1.1.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

This case exemplifies the addition of a species of interest to a blank electrolyte for electrochemical investigation.

The current-potential curve is shown in Figure 1.1.7. Note the appearance of a reduction wave at about -0.4 V vs. NHE arising from the reduction reaction

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{CdBr}_{4}^{2-}+2 e \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Hg}} \mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{Hg})+4 \mathrm{Br}^{-} \tag{1.1.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{Hg})$ denotes cadmium amalgam (i.e., with Cd atoms dissolved in the Hg ). The shape and height of such a wave will be covered in Section 1.3.2. ${ }^{16}$

#### (e) Precedence of Electrode Reactions

When the potential of an electrode is moved from its open-circuit value toward more negative potentials, the substance that will be reduced first (assuming all possible electrode reactions have fast kinetics) is the oxidant in the couple with the least negative (or most positive) $E^{0}$. For example, consider Figure 1.1.8a, which relates to a platinum electrode immersed in an aqueous solution containing 0.01 M each of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$, and $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ in 1 M HCl . The first substance reduced will be $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, since the $E^{0}$ of this couple is most positive.

Figure 1.1.8 (a) Potentials for possible reductions at a platinum electrode, initially at $\sim 1 \mathrm{~V}$ vs. NHE in a solution of 0.01 M each of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$, and $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ in 1 M HCl . (b) Potentials for possible oxidation reactions at a gold electrode, initially at $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~V}$ vs. NHE in a solution of 0.01 M each of $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in 1 M HI . (c) Potentials for possible reductions at a mercury electrode in $0.01 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ in 1 M HCl . The arrows indicate the directions of potential change discussed in the text. Potentials are plotted with the negative direction upward, because this direction corresponds with increasing energy of the available electrons on the electrode (Sections 1.1.4 and 2.2.5). Plotting potentials in $i-E$ curves with the negative direction to the right is consistent with this consideration.

Likewise, when the potential of the electrode is moved from its open-circuit value toward more positive potentials, the substance that will be oxidized first is the reductant in the couple of least positive (or most negative) $E^{0}$. Thus, for a gold electrode in an aqueous solution containing 0.01 M each of $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in 1 M HI (Figure 1.1.8b), the $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ will be first oxidized, since the $E^{0}$ of this couple is least positive.

One must remember, however, that these predictions are based on thermodynamic considerations (i.e., reaction energetics). Slow kinetics might prevent an electrode reaction from occurring at a significant rate in a potential region where the standard potential suggests that the reaction is possible. For a mercury electrode immersed in a solution of 0.01 M each of $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ in 1 M HCl (Figure 1.1.8c), the first reduction process predicted is the evolution of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. As discussed earlier, this reaction is very slow on mercury, so the first process actually observed is the reduction of $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$.

None of the cases in Figure 1.1.8 involves a redox couple for which both redox forms are present; consequently, there is no equilibrium defining the open-circuit potential of the electrode. In every electrochemical system, the open-circuit potential lies between the easiest oxidation and the easiest reduction. If, apart from species defining the background limits, the solution contains only oxidized forms eligible for reduction (as in Figure 1.1.8a,c), the open-circuit potential must lie between the positive background limit and the standard potential for the first electroreduction. If the solution contains only reduced forms eligible for oxidation (as in Figure 1.1.8b), the open-circuit potential must lie between the negative background limit and the standard potential for the first electrooxidation.

#### (f) Both Redox Forms of a Couple as Solutes

In some systems, both redox forms of a couple are present as solutes, and the behavior differs notably from the cases we have been discussing. Suppose, for example, that we make three changes in the cell of Figure 1.1.4:

- Employing a silver electrode covered with AgCl , rather than one covered with AgBr .
- Adopting a vessel having two compartments, one for each electrode, separated internally by a frit.
- Placing 1 M HCl in each compartment, but also including $2 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ and $4 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})$ in the solution at the Pt electrode.

Thus, the cell becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})(4 \mathrm{mM}), \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})(2 \mathrm{mM}) / / \mathrm{H}^{+}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{AgCl} / \mathrm{Ag} \tag{1.1.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

The compartments are employed to keep Fe(III) species away from the silver electrode, where they would otherwise react by oxidizing the metal. The frit prevents bulk mixing of the solutions in the two compartments, but allows them to remain in ionic electrical contact.

In this system, the silver electrode becomes an $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ reference, ${ }^{17}$ and the cell potential is the potential of the Pt working electrode against that reference, which can be re-expressed on the NHE scale, essentially as was done for Figures 1.1.6 and 1.1.7.

The iron species exist in 1 M HCl as chloro complexes, so we simply write the relevant couple as ${ }^{18}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II}) \quad E^{0^{\prime}}=+0.70 \mathrm{~V} \text { vs. } \mathrm{NHE}(1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}) \tag{1.1.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 1.1.9 Current-potential curve for a Pt working electrode in a system in which both $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})$ and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ are present in the working solution. Cell configuration identified at top. A composite wave exists in which Fe(III) is reduced on the negative side of the open-circuit potential and $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ is oxidized on the positive side.

Because the Pt electrode is in contact with both redox forms, the working electrode is poised by the $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ and shows a true equilibrium potential near $E^{0^{\prime}}$ for (1.1.24). The current-potential curve is depicted in Figure 1.1.9.

As the potential moves negatively from the open-circuit potential, reduction of Fe (III) is immediately possible, because the open-circuit potential is already in the range of $E^{0^{\prime}}$ for the couple. At open circuit (zero current), there is a dynamic equilibrium. The redox process proceeds in both directions [Fe(III) being reduced and Fe (II) being oxidized], but the rates are balanced and there is no net current. Negative movement of the potential away from the equilibrium value unbalances the rates to give a net cathodic current. Likewise, as the potential moves positively from the open-circuit value, net oxidation of Fe (II) is immediately possible.

The overall result is a composite wave for the Fe (III)/Fe(II) couple having both anodic and cathodic components, spanning $E^{0^{\prime}}$. It is important to understand the essential continuity of oxidation and reduction for a given electrode process. We will emphasize it repeatedly in Section 1.3.2(b), in Chapters 3 and 5, and elsewhere.

Through these simple examples, we have seen that current-potential curves have many features in common with spectra arising from various forms of spectroscopy. In the most general terms, spectra represent the probability of a transition vs. the energy of a probing photon, and they are marked by features that can be exploited for qualitative identification, quantitative determination, or diagnosis of behavior. Current-potential curves represent the rate and direction of reaction at a working electrode vs. the energy of transferable electrons on that electrode, and they are also marked by features that can be exploited toward the same ends. Like spectra, current-potential curves are reflective of the electronic structures of participants; but unlike most spectra, they are essentially kinetic in basis. One must understand the contributing dynamics in the relevant electrode reactions to understand the curves fully. Current-potential curves arise from many different electrochemical methods, and we will be working constantly with them.

### 1.1.8 Control of Current vs. Control of Potential

Our work with $i-E$ curves is already substantial enough to suggest that there is a functional relationship between current and potential in electrochemical systems. Dictating one of these
variables determines the other, if experimental conditions otherwise remain constant. If one chooses to control the potential of the working electrode, for example, then the reaction energetics become defined by that election. The reaction rate and its time dependence (and, thus, the current and its time dependence) follow as consequences. Alternatively, one can choose to control the current, defining the reaction rate at the working electrode. Then, the energetics follow, as does the potential-time function.

There is an analogy with the behavior of homogeneous reactions, for which one can vary rate with temperature. However, one cannot control both reaction rate and reaction temperature under otherwise constant conditions. If one wants a given rate, one must accept the required temperature $v s$. time. Or if one wants to operate at a given temperature, one must accept the reaction rate vs. time.

Newcomers to electrochemistry often miss the point that current and potential cannot be controlled simultaneously in experimental systems, unless some other important variable, such as temperature, can change at the same time.

### 1.1.9 Faradaic and Nonfaradaic Processes

Two distinct classes of processes occur at electrodes. The more familiar group comprises reactions like those we have been discussing, in which electrons are transferred, oxidation or reduction happens, and charge moves across the electrode/solution interface. These events are stoichiometric and are governed by Faraday's law; thus, they are called faradaic processes. Electrodes at which faradaic processes occur are sometimes called charge-transfer electrodes.

We have also seen that a given electrode/solution interface can show a range of potentials where no charge-transfer reactions occur, because all such reactions are thermodynamically or kinetically unfavorable (e.g., the region in Figure 1.1.6 between -0.2 V and -0.8 V vs. NHE). However, the distribution of ions at the electrode/solution interface does change with changing potential or solution composition. Events at the electrode surface that do not involve charge transfer are called nonfaradaic. Even though charge does not cross the interface, nonfaradaic processes can cause external currents to flow, at least transiently, when the potential, electrode area, or solution composition changes. In studies focused on the nature of the electrode/solution interface, nonfaradaic processes can become the primary concern.

For now, we will continue to focus on faradaic processes, but in Section 1.6, we will discuss systems in which only nonfaradaic processes occur.
