# Chapter 1 Glossary

## capacitive current

**capacitive current** is the current associated with charging or discharging the electrode/solution interface treated as a capacitor, without net interfacial charge-transfer chemistry. In Chapter 1, it is synonymous with **charging current** and is a non-faradaic contribution to measured current.

## charging current

**charging current** is the transient current that flows when the electrode/solution interface accumulates or releases charge in response to a change in applied potential, analogous to charging a capacitor. In Chapter 1 it is a non-faradaic current that can appear even when no interfacial redox reaction proceeds.

## diffuse layer

The **diffuse layer** is the part of the solution-side double layer in which excess ionic charge is distributed into the electrolyte volume (three-dimensionally) rather than confined to a compact plane. In Chapter 1 lecture notes, it begins beyond the compact-layer boundary (near the OHP) and extends toward the bulk solution.

## electric double layer

The **electric double layer** is the structured interfacial region at an electrode/solution boundary in which excess charge on the electrode is balanced by an oppositely signed distribution of charge in the adjacent solution (and by oriented dipoles), so that electroneutrality is maintained overall while charge is spatially separated into layers.

## faradaic process

A **faradaic process** is an interfacial process in which charge crosses the electrode/solution interface by an oxidation–reduction (electron-transfer) reaction. In Chapter 1, Faraday’s law connects the amount of chemical change (electron transfer) to the charge passed.

## ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)

An **ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)** is an idealized electrode/solution interface across which no charge-transfer reaction occurs over the potential range of interest. In Chapter 1, an IPE is modeled as a capacitor: applying a potential changes interfacial charge and structure rather than driving net electron-transfer chemistry.

## inner Helmholtz plane (IHP)

The **inner Helmholtz plane (IHP)** is an idealized plane near the electrode surface associated with the compact, inner-layer structure, including the closest approach of specifically adsorbed ions at the interface.

## non-faradaic process

A **non-faradaic process** is an interfacial response in which no net charge-transfer chemistry occurs across the electrode/solution interface. In Chapter 1, the resulting measurable current is associated with charging of the double layer (capacitive/charging current), often because the relevant charge-transfer reactions are thermodynamically or kinetically unfavorable.

## non-faradaic window

A **non-faradaic window** is a range of applied potentials over which interfacial charge-transfer (faradaic) reactions are negligible, so the measured current is dominated by double-layer charging (capacitive) contributions.

## non-specifically adsorbed ion

A **non-specifically adsorbed ion** is an ion near the interface that is not bound in a specific adsorption site, but instead is distributed in the electrolyte and interacts with the electrode primarily through long-range electrostatic forces as part of the diffuse screening cloud.

## outer Helmholtz plane (OHP)

The **outer Helmholtz plane (OHP)** is an idealized plane marking the outer boundary of the compact (inner) layer, beyond which the diffuse-layer charge distribution extends into the bulk electrolyte.

## poised system

A **poised system** is a system in which a redox pair is present in bulk solution in a way that allows the electrode potential to be described (over the relevant time scale) by a Nernstian dependence on oxidized/reduced composition.

## specifically adsorbed ion

A **specifically adsorbed ion** is an ion that resides in the compact part of the double layer in close proximity to the electrode surface, typically treated as having a well-defined closest-approach plane (associated with the IHP) rather than being distributed purely as part of the diffuse layer.
