1.1.3: See Problem #4

Let us now become more quantitative about the sizes and shapes of current-potential curves. We must be able to describe the rate of reaction at the electrode surface if we are to understand $i$.

In the simplest electrode reactions, the participants are chemically stable, and the rates of all associated chemical reactions are very rapid compared to those of the mass-transfer processes.

[^13]We will find in Chapters 3 and 5 that if an electrode reaction involves only fast heterogeneous charge-transfer kinetics and mobile, reversible homogeneous reactions, then

- The homogeneous reactions can be regarded as being at equilibrium.
- The surface concentrations of species involved in the faradaic process are related to the electrode potential by an equation of the Nernst form.

Such electrode reactions are called reversible or nernstian, because the principal species obey thermodynamic relationships at the electrode surface.

In nernstian systems, the net rate of the electrode reaction is governed totally by the rate at which the electroreactant is brought to the surface by mass transfer, $v_{\mathrm{mt}}\left(\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$. From (1.1.15), ${ }^{27}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{mt}}= \pm i / n F A \quad(+ \text { for a reduction, }- \text { for an oxidation }) \tag{1.3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since mass transfer plays a big role in electrochemical dynamics, we will next review its three modes and then consider mathematical methods for treating them.

### 1.3.1 Modes of Mass Transfer

Mass transfer-the movement of material from one location in solution to another-arises from differences in electrical or chemical potential at the two locations or from the physical movement of volume elements of solution. The modes of mass transfer, amplified in Chapter 4, are:

- Migration. Movement of a charged body under the influence of an electric field (a gradient of electrical potential). ${ }^{28}$
- Diffusion. Movement of a species under the influence of a gradient of chemical potential (i.e., a concentration gradient).
- Convection. Stirring or hydrodynamic transport. Fluid flow occurs because of natural convection (convection caused by density gradients) and forced convection, and is characterized by stagnant regions, laminar flow, and turbulent flow.

Mass transfer to an electrode surface is governed by the Nernst-Planck equation, written in the following way for one-dimensional mass transfer along the $x$-axis, normal to the surface,

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{j}(x)=-D_{j} \frac{\partial C_{j}(x)}{\partial x}-\frac{z_{j} F}{R T} D_{j} C_{j}(x) \frac{\partial \phi(x)}{\partial x}+C_{j}(x) v(x) \tag{1.3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $J_{j}(x)$ is called the flux of species $j\left(\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right)$ at distance $x$ from the surface. This is the net rate at which the species crosses a unit area at $x$. A positive flux describes net movement toward greater $x$. In this equation, $D_{j}$ is the diffusion coefficient $\left(\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}\right) ; \partial C_{j}(x) / \partial x$ is the concentration gradient at distance $x ; \partial \phi / \partial x$ is the potential gradient; $z_{j}$ and $C_{j}$ are the charge (dimensionless) and concentration $\left(\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$ of species $j$, respectively; and $v(x)$ is the velocity $(\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s})$ with which a solution volume element at $x$ translates along the axis. The Nernst-Planck equation is derived and discussed in Chapter 4. The three terms on the right side represent the contributions of diffusion, migration, and convection to the flux.

The flux of species $j$ at the electrode surface, $J_{j}(x=0)$, has a special interpretation. If it is negative, then it describes a flux into the surface and must be understood chemically as the rate

[^14]at which species $j$ is consumed by electrolysis. If positive, it describes a flux out of the surface and, therefore, the rate at which species $j$ is produced by the electrode reaction. If it is zero, then species $j$ is neither a reactant nor a product of the electrode reaction.

Suppose species $k$ is the only electroreactant. We can identify the flux magnitude $\left|J_{k}(x=0)\right|$ as $v_{\mathrm{mt}}$ in (1.3.1), from which we obtain,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{|i|}{n F A}=\left|J_{k}(x=0)\right| \tag{1.3.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

In later chapters, we will use the Nernst-Planck equation to calculate mass-transfer-limited currents for many different experimental circumstances. Computing the flux is complex when all three forms of mass transfer contribute; hence, electrochemical systems are often designed to render one or two of the contributions negligible. For example, the migrational component can be reduced to unimportance by adding an inert electrolyte (a supporting electrolyte) at a concentration much larger than that of the electroactive species (Section 4.3.2). Convection can be avoided by preventing stirring in the electrochemical cell. Alternatively, convection can be made dominant in a well-defined way by using a rotating disk electrode or a flow cell.

In the rest of this section, we present an approximate treatment of steady-state mass transfer, which will give insight into electrochemical reactions without elaborate mathematical detail.

### 1.3.2 Semiempirical Treatment of Steady-State Mass Transfer

Consider the reduction of a species O at a cathode, $\mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$. In an actual case, the oxidized form, O , might be $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-}$, and the reduced form, R , might be $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{4-}$, but with only $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-}$ initially present at the millimolar level in a solution of $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$. We envision a cell with a platinum working electrode and an SCE reference electrode, and we focus on conditions that produce steady-state mass transfer to the electrode surface.

An effective approach is to make the working electrode in the form of a disk embedded in an insulator and to rotate the assembly at a known rate about its central axis; this is a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and is discussed in Section 10.2. The rotation causes steady fluid flow upward along the axis of rotation, then radially outward from the face of the electrode because of centrifugal effects. It is characteristic of the RDE to deliver a steady current when the electrode is held at a potential where an electrochemical reaction can occur. If the potential is changed, the system will establish a new steady state after a brief transition.

Steady-state behavior can be obtained in other systems, too. The most important cases involve very small working electrodes shaped as spheres, hemispheres, or disks. These have radii from $25 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ to 10 nm and are known as ultramicroelectrodes (UME). Chapter 5 is wholly dedicated to steady-state experiments at UMEs. The basis for attaining a steady state at a UME is not as intuitive as at an RDE, so we concentrate now on the latter; however, the results derived here apply broadly to steady-state systems.

Once electrolysis begins at an RDE, species O is consumed at the electrode surface, so its surface concentration, $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$, becomes smaller than the value in bulk solution, $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$. A concentration profile develops from the surface to the bulk, as shown by either of the solid curves in Figure 1.3.1. Stirring is ineffective near the electrode surface, so a stagnant layer (sometimes called the Nernst diffusion layer) extends outward for a thickness, $\delta_{\mathrm{O}}$. Beyond $x=\delta_{\mathrm{O}}$, convection is assumed to maintain the concentration at $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ (dashed lines in Figure 1.3.1). Since there is an excess of supporting electrolyte, migration is not important anywhere.

Inside the diffusion layer ( $x<\delta_{\mathrm{O}}$ ), where neither convection nor migration are operative, the flux of O is given by the first (diffusive) term in (1.3.2). At the electrode surface,

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=-D_{\mathrm{O}}\left(d C_{\mathrm{O}} / d x\right)_{x=0} \tag{1.3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-26.jpg?height=465&width=667&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=189)
Figure 1.3.1 Concentration profiles (solid lines) and diffusion-layer approximation (dashed lines). $x=0$ corresponds to the electrode surface, and $\delta_{\mathrm{O}}$ is the diffusion layer thickness. Concentration profiles are shown at two different electrode potentials: (1) where $C_{0}(x=0)$ is about $C_{0}^{*} / 2$, (2) where $C_{0}(x=0) \approx 0$ and $i=i_{l}$. When a system achieves steady state, the concentration profile remains steady, and the flux of O is the same at any plane.

If one further assumes a linear concentration gradient within the diffusion layer, then, from equation (1.3.4)

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=-D_{\mathrm{O}}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\right] / \delta_{\mathrm{O}} \tag{1.3.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $\delta_{\mathrm{O}}$ is often unknown, it is convenient to combine it with the diffusion coefficient as $m_{\mathrm{O}}=D_{\mathrm{O}} / \delta_{\mathrm{O}}$, and to write equation (1.3.4) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
J_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=-m_{\mathrm{O}}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\right] \tag{1.3.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the mass-transfer coefficient, $m_{\mathrm{O}}$, has units of $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s} .^{29}$
From equations (1.3.3) and (1.3.6), with recognition that $i$ is positive for the reduction occurring at the electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{n F A}=m_{\mathrm{O}}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\right] \tag{1.3.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

At the same time, R is produced at the electrode surface, so that $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)>C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ (where $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ is the bulk concentration of R ). Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{n F A}=m_{\mathrm{R}}\left[C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)-C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\right] \tag{1.3.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the case when $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}=0$ (no R in the bulk solution),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{n F A}=m_{\mathrm{R}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0) \tag{1.3.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The values of $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)$ depend on the electrode potential, $E$. The largest rate of mass transfer of O occurs when $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ is driven to zero-or more precisely, when $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \ll C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$, so that $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \approx C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$. The value of the current under these conditions is called the limiting current, $i_{l}$, where

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{l}=n F A m_{\mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*} \tag{1.3.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

When the current reaches its limiting value, the electrode process is occurring at the maximum rate possible for a given set of mass-transfer conditions, because O is being reduced as fast as it can be brought to the electrode surface.

[^15]Equations (1.3.7) and (1.3.10) can be combined to obtain expressions for $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ :

$$
\begin{array}{|l|}
\hline \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}=1-\frac{i}{i_{l}} \\
C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=\frac{i_{l}-i}{n F A m_{\mathrm{O}}} \tag{1.3.12}
\end{array}
$$

Thus, the concentration of species O at the electrode surface is linearly related to the current and varies from $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$, when $i=0$, to a negligible value, when $i=i_{l}$.

If the kinetics of interfacial electron transfer are rapid, the concentrations of O and R at the electrode surface can be assumed to be at equilibrium with the electrode potential, as governed by the Nernst equation for the half-reaction ${ }^{30}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)} \tag{1.3.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

We can derive the steady-state $i-E$ curves for this nernstian system under several different conditions.

#### (a) $R$ Initially Absent

When $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}=0, C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)$ can be obtained from (1.3.9):

$$
\begin{equation*}
C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)=i / n F A m_{\mathrm{R}} \tag{1.3.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

Then, combining equations (1.3.12)-(1.3.14), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l}-i}{i}\right) \tag{1.3.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

An $i-E$ plot is shown in Figure 1.3.2a. Note that when $i=i_{l} / 2$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{1 / 2}=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}} \tag{1.3.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{1 / 2}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l}-i}{i}\right) \tag{1.3.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

The half-wave potential, $E_{1 / 2}$, is independent of the substrate concentration and is, therefore, characteristic of the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ system. When $m_{\mathrm{O}}$ and $m_{\mathrm{R}}$ have similar values (as they often do), $E_{1 / 2}$ is within a few mV of $E^{0^{\prime}}$.

When a system conforms to (1.3.17), a plot of $E v s . \log \left[\left(i_{l}-i\right) / i\right]$ is a straight line with a slope of $2.3 R T / n F$ (or $59.1 / n \mathrm{mV}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Alternatively (Figure 1.3.2b), $\log \left[\left(i_{l}-i\right) / i\right]$ vs. $E$ is linear with a slope of $n F / 2.3 R T$ (or $n / 59.1 \mathrm{mV}^{-1}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) and has an $E$-intercept of $E_{1 / 2}$.

The limiting current is proportional to the bulk concentration of species O and can be used as the basis for analytical determinations, usually by calibration or standard addition.

With this simple example, we see that the position of the reversible wave on the potential axis is determined by the standard potential of the electrode reaction and that different features of the wave can provide access to chemical information, including $E_{1 / 2}, E^{0^{\prime}}, C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}, m_{\mathrm{O}}$, or $n$, depending on what might otherwise be known about the system.

#### (b) Both $O$ and $R$ Initially Present

When both members of the redox couple exist in the bulk, we must distinguish between a cathodic limiting current, $i_{l, \mathrm{c}}$, when $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \approx 0$, and an anodic limiting current, $i_{l, \mathrm{a}}$, when $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0) \approx 0$. We still have $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ given by (1.3.12), but with $i_{l}$ now specified as $i_{l, \mathrm{c}}$. The limiting anodic current reflects the maximum rate at which R can be brought to the electrode surface for conversion to O . It is obtained from (1.3.8):

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{l, \mathrm{a}}=-n F A m_{\mathrm{R}} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*} \tag{1.3.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

(The negative sign arises because of our convention that anodic currents are negative.) Thus, $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)$ is given by

$$
\begin{align*}
& C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)=\frac{i-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}}{n F A m_{\mathrm{R}}}  \tag{1.3.19}\\
& \frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}=1-\frac{i}{i_{l, \mathrm{a}}} \tag{1.3.20}
\end{align*}
$$

The $i-E$ curve is then

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l, \mathrm{c}}-i}{i-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}}\right) \tag{1.3.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{1 / 2}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l, \mathrm{c}}-i}{i-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}}\right) \tag{1.3.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $E_{1 / 2}$ is as defined in (1.3.16). It is the potential where the current is exactly halfway between the two limiting currents; i.e., when $i=\left(i_{l, \mathrm{c}}+i_{l, \mathrm{a}}\right) / 2$.

A plot of this equation is shown in Figure 1.3.3. When $i=0, E=E_{\mathrm{eq}}$ and the system is at equilibrium. Surface concentrations are then equal to the bulk values. When current flows, the potential deviates from $E_{\text {eq }}$, and the extent of this deviation is the mass-transfer overpotential. (An equilibrium potential is not defined for the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ system when only one member of the redox couple is present, e.g., where $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}=0$ as in Figure 1.3.2.)

Figure 1.3.3 Current-potential curve for a nernstian system involving two soluble species with both forms initially present.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-29.jpg?height=479&width=503&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=1062)

The chemical information available from this wave is similar to that for the case without R initially present; however, there is more here, because $i_{l, \mathrm{a}}$ and $i_{l, \mathrm{c}}$ are independently informative. The anodic limiting current is proportional to $m_{\mathrm{R}} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$; the cathodic limiting current, to $m_{\mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$.

Note that the reduction of O is not widely separated on the potential axis from the oxidation of R . The transition from one to the other is smooth, happening in a single wave. On the negative side of $E_{\text {eq }}$ (the zero-current potential), net reduction occurs. On the positive side, net oxidation. The whole wave is found in the region of $E^{0^{\prime}}$ for the reaction. These are characteristics of reversible systems, for which kinetics are fast and mass transfer controls the response. [See also the discussion of the $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ couple in Section 1.1.7(f).] Many newcomers to electrochemistry acquire the notion that reduction and oxidation are separated widely on the potential axis, one near $E^{0^{\prime}}$ and the other near $-E^{0^{\prime}}$. It is important to avoid that mistaken idea. ${ }^{31}$

#### (c) R Present as the Electrode Material

Now suppose that species R is a metal, and the electrode reaction occurs on bulk R (e.g., $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}$ ). Usually R is at unit activity, ${ }^{32}$ so the Nernst equation becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \tag{1.3.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

Using the value of $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ from equation (1.3.11),

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l}-i}{i_{l}}\right) \tag{1.3.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

The corresponding current-potential curve is shown in Figure 1.3.4. When $i=0, E=E_{\text {eq }}= E^{0^{\prime}}+(R T / n F) \ln C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$.

In Sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, we saw that the overpotential, $\eta=E-E_{\text {eq }}$, needed to deliver a current is normally a sum of separate overpotentials driving mass transfer, the electrode kinetics, and any other dynamics involved in the electrode reaction. In a reversible case all kinetics are

[^17]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-30.jpg?height=557&width=991&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=183)
Figure 1.3.4 Current-potential curve for a nernstian system where the reduced form is the electrode material. The potential axis is referenced to the equilibrium potential. On the negative side of $E_{\text {eq }}$, species $O$ is reduced at the electrode and is electrodeposited on the surface. A limiting current is reached for large negative overpotentials. On the positive side of $E_{\mathrm{eq}}$, species R is oxidized and dissolves into the solution from the surface of the electrode. Since there is no mass-transfer limitation on the availability of $R$ at the surface, the current increases (negatively) as greater overpotentials are applied.

fast, so the overpotential is entirely a mass-transfer overpotential, $\eta_{\mathrm{mt}} \cdot{ }^{33}$ Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{\mathrm{mt}}=\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \left(\frac{i_{l}-i}{i_{l}}\right) \tag{1.3.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

When $i=i_{l}, \eta_{\mathrm{mt}} \rightarrow-\infty .^{34}$
Equation (1.3.25) can be written in exponential form:

$$
\begin{equation*}
1-\frac{i}{i_{l}}=\exp \left(\frac{n F \eta_{\mathrm{mt}}}{R T}\right) \tag{1.3.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

The exponential can be expanded as a power series, and the higher-order terms can be dropped if the argument is kept small; that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{x}=1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2}+\cdots \approx 1+x(\text { when } x \text { is small }) \tag{1.3.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, under conditions of small deviations of potential from $E_{\mathrm{eq}}$, the $i-\eta_{\mathrm{mt}}$ characteristic is linear:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta_{\mathrm{mt}}=-\frac{R T i}{n F i_{l}} \tag{1.3.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $-\eta / i$ has dimensions of resistance (ohms), we can define a "small-signal" mass-transfer resistance, $R_{\mathrm{mt}}$, as

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{mt}}=\frac{R T}{n F i_{l}} \tag{1.3.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^18]Here we see that the mass-transfer-limited electrode reaction resembles an actual resistance element, but only at small overpotentials. ${ }^{35}$
