Electrochemistry allows the controlled addition or removal of electrons, often one by one, at molecules or ions arriving very near a metallic or semiconducting electrode. Electrochemical systems provide access to fundamental chemical events and valuable practical applications; however, the science also entails complexity. Key events often take place in a tiny fraction of the total volume, typically at or very near metallic surfaces, or perhaps only at rare active sites on surfaces. The reacting molecules or ions must be transported to the locales of reaction, and the processes of transport influence reaction rates. Once a reaction is initiated at an electrode, it can proceed through a mechanism involving almost any kind of chemical step-proton transfer, a change in ligation, elimination, rearrangement, or even subsequent electron transfer-either at the electrode or with other molecules or ions. Reactions at electrodes involve the orbital structures of ions and molecules and the band structures of metals, semiconductors, and insulators. They depend, too, on electrostatics and thermodynamics. Among the domains of chemistry, electrochemistry offers some of the greatest challenges to effective theory and experimental examination; yet, over two centuries of genuine science, a strong base of theory and experimental methodology has been assembled. This book presents the most essential aspects.

Electrochemistry connects electrical and chemical effects. Much of it deals with either chemical changes caused by passage of an electric current or the production of electrical energy by chemical reactions. Yet, the field extends broadly to encompass diverse phenomena (e.g., electrophoresis and corrosion), devices (such as electrochromic displays, electroanalytical sensors, and fuel cells), and technologies (including portable power for electronic devices or automobiles, large-scale energy storage for load management on the electric power grid, electroplating of metals, and large-scale production of materials, such as aluminum and chlorine). While the basic principles of electrochemistry discussed in this text apply to all such topics, the main emphasis here is on the application of electrochemical methods to the study of chemical systems.

Scientists make electrochemical measurements for a variety of reasons. They may want to understand the kinetics of a reaction at an electrode, perhaps to speed it up, to inhibit it, or to optimize product yield. They may want to generate an unstable intermediate, such as a radical ion, and study its rate of decay or its spectroscopic properties. They may seek to analyze a solution for trace species. They may be interested in obtaining thermodynamic data about a reaction. In these examples, electrochemical methods are employed as tools in the study of chemical systems, much in the manner of spectroscopic methods. Many electrochemical methods have been devised. Their application requires an understanding of the fundamental principles of reactions at electrodes and the electrical properties of electrode/solution interfaces.

This chapter sets a stage. It introduces the terms and concepts used to describe electrochemical systems. In the process, it covers interfaces and cells; potential and current; reference electrodes and the measurement of potential; concepts of electrochemical experimentation;
the dynamics behind current-potential curves; the extraction of chemical information from electrochemical responses; faradaic and nonfaradaic processes; double-layer structure and charging currents. The tour of ideas is designed to help the reader to establish an elementary working knowledge of electrochemical concepts and systems.

If the larger goal is to learn how to employ electrochemical methods reliably, far more is needed. The journey just begins in Chapter 1. The ideas and treatments introduced here are developed much more fully and rigorously in later chapters.
