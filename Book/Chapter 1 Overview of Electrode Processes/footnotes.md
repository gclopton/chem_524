[^0]:    1 Questions are sometimes asked about conduction in solutions by "free" electrons. Such species are very short lived and contribute negligibly to conductivity. "Solvated" electrons can exist in exceptional circumstances (Section 20.4), but are generally very reactive. Overwhelmingly, the mobile charges in solutions are ions, and electrons exchanged at an electrode are carried in solution by atoms, molecules, and ions.
    2 bpy $=2,2^{\prime}$-bipyridine (Figure 1).

[^1]:    3 A double slash, not yet used here, represents a phase boundary whose interfacial potential difference is regarded as a negligible component of the overall cell potential.

[^2]:    4 Sometimes called the indicator electrode.
    5 Activity is a concept used extensively in thermodynamics to take account of the effects of concentrations, partial pressures, or mole fractions. See Section 2.1.5 for detail. For now, just think of it as a representation of concentration, pressure, or mole fraction, in which "unit activity" would correspond roughly to a 1 M solution, to a partial pressure of $10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ (1 bar), or to a pure solid.
    6 Thus, the NHE would involve something like $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}^{+}$and gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ at close to 1 bar ( $1.01325 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ ).
    7 The NHE is not actually realizable except by extrapolation of the behavior of real electrodes. For now, it is not necessary for us to go into how this is done. We just need to recognize that the NHE is not an everyday reference electrode.

[^3]:    8 And because other interfacial potential differences in the system, such as those at metal-metal contacts (Figure 1.1.2) also remain constant.
    9 The eV is a convenient unit of energy in electrochemical studies. It is the work required to move a positive test charge equal in magnitude to the electronic charge, $e$, across a barrier of 1 V . In general, $\Delta \mathbf{E}=q \Delta \phi$, where $\Delta \mathbf{E}$ is the change in energy, $q$ is the charge being moved, and $\Delta \phi$ is the electric potential difference across which the charge is moved. When $q$ is expressed in units of $e$ and $\Delta \phi$ is in $\mathrm{V}, \Delta \mathbf{E}$ is in eV .

[^4]:    10 The number of moles of electrons passed is sometimes called the number of equivalents.

[^5]:    11 Also called the zero-current potential or the rest potential. The term rest potential has been blurred in recent years by inconsistent usage. In this book, we will use only open-circuit potential or zero-current potential to avoid confusion.

[^6]:    12 When a redox couple is present at each electrode and there are no contributions from liquid junctions (yet to be discussed), the open-circuit potential is also the equilibrium potential. This is the situation for both cells in Figure 1.1.1.
    13 In this case, one of the two electrodes is a genuine reference electrode, but this is not true in all two-electrode cells.
    14 The convention of taking $i$ positive for a cathodic current stems from early work at Hg electrodes, where reduction reactions were usually studied. By making this choice and plotting negative potentials toward the right, it is possible to represent data in first-quadrant graphs. This convention has the drawback of having increasingly positive currents corresponding to increasingly negative potentials; therefore, it sometimes seems peculiar. Yet, it has continued among many practitioners, even though oxidation reactions are now studied quite commonly. The authors considered a change to the opposite convention for this edition, but have elected to retain the historical practice for two main reasons: (a) The literature was dominated for a long time by this convention, and most figures that we have taken from the literature follow it. (b) There is a pedagogical advantage in consistently writing half-cell reactions in the reductive direction, as we will see in Chapter 2. Even so, many practitioners prefer to take anodic current as positive and to plot positive potentials toward the right. When looking over a derivation in the literature or examining a published $i-E$ curve, it is important to recognize which convention is being used (i.e., "Which way is up?"). Given history and contemporary practice, one has no choice but to become versatile about these things.

[^7]:    15 Although the flow of current in the cell will cause chemical conversion of some $\mathrm{Ag}+\mathrm{Br}^{-}$into AgBr or vice versa, the amounts of reaction are typically very small and will not appreciably change the bulk concentration of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$. Also, the reference electrode is often made significantly bigger than the working electrode and is sealed off from the working electrode with an ionically conducting barrier, such as a frit or a fiber. These precautions give the reference electrode an ability to accept the passage of modest current with negligible overall compositional change and to avoid contamination from the working side of the cell.

[^8]:    16 If $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ were added to the cell in Figure 1.1.4 and a current-potential curve taken, the result would be essentially the same as in Figure 1.1.5, found in the absence of $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$. At a Pt electrode, proton reduction occurs at less negative potentials than are required for the reduction of $\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{II})$, so the cathodic background limit occurs in 1 M HBr far before the cadmium reduction wave can be seen.

[^9]:    17 Although with 1 M HCl , rather than the usual case of saturated KCl .
    18 In this case, we use a medium-specific formal potential, $E^{0^{\prime}}$ rather than the standard potential, $E^{0}$, because of the complexation that takes place. Chapter 2 explains formal potentials. For now, just regard the formal potential as functionally the same as the standard potential.

[^10]:    19 Because a cathodic current and a cathodic reaction can occur at an electrode that is either positive or negative with respect to another electrode (e.g., a reference electrode), it is poor usage to associate the term "cathodic" or "anodic" with potentials of a particular sign. For example, one should not say, "The potential shifted in a cathodic direction," when what is meant is, "The potential shifted in a negative direction." The terms anodic and cathodic refer to electron flow or current direction, not to potential.

[^11]:    20 This value is calculated from the Nernst equation using the information in Figure 1.2.4. The experimental value would also include the effects of activity coefficients and the liquid junction potential, which are neglected here. See Chapter 2.
    21 These terms are carryovers from history and do not always represent the best possible terminology. However, their use is so ingrained in electrochemical jargon that it seems wisest to keep them and to define them as precisely as possible.
    22 In the electrochemical literature, the term polarization describes the departure of an electrode from some reference point, but not always from an equilibrium potential. Overpotential is the measure of polarization relative to the chosen reference point.
    23 An INE is also known as an ideally depolarized electrode (IDE). A substance is called a depolarizer if it causes an electrode to operate at a less extreme potential (i.e., to be nearer to its zero-current value) by virtue of being oxidized or reduced. Thus, ideal depolarization would yield the $i-E$ curve in Figure 1.2.5a.
    24 The term depolarizer is also frequently used to denote a substance that is preferentially oxidized or reduced, to prevent an undesirable electrode reaction. Sometimes, it is simply another name for an electroactive substance.

[^12]:    25 The bulk solution (often just called the bulk) is the body of solution sufficiently far from an electrode to have uniform composition at all points and, therefore, no gradient in concentration driven by processes at the electrode. Near the electrode, electroreactants are consumed and electroproducts are generated, so concentration gradients exist and are important. On a lab scale, the bulk is not very far from an electrode, typically less than a few hundred micrometers away. In many experiments, the bulk remains essentially unaffected by the electrode process; however, one cannot assume that it is always unaffected. Cells with large electrodes and efficient mass transfer can have the purpose of transforming the whole system, especially if the goal is to synthesize a product electrolytically. Systems built for "bulk electrolysis" are discussed in Chapter 12.

[^13]:    26 More accurately, what we have labeled as resistances should be considered as impedances. However, these impedances are functions (often very strong functions) of $E$ or $i$, unlike the analogous ideal electrical elements. Typically, linear models like Figure 1.2.7 apply quantitatively only for very small perturbations about the equilibrium point, i.e., only when a small signal is applied.

[^14]:    $27 v_{\text {mt }}$ is an unsigned quantity. The explicit signs in (1.3.1) are in recognition that the current is positive for a reduction and negative for an oxidation.
    28 Sometimes called drift.

[^15]:    29 While $m_{\mathrm{O}}$ is treated here as a phenomenological parameter, in more exact treatments the value of $m_{\mathrm{O}}$ can sometimes be specified in terms of measurable quantities. For the rotating disk electrode (Section 10.2.2), $m_{\mathrm{O}}=0.62 D_{\mathrm{O}}^{2 / 3} \omega^{1 / 2} \nu^{-1 / 6}$ where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the disk (i.e., $2 \pi f$, with $f$ being the frequency in revolutions per second) and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity (i.e., viscosity/density, with units of $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ ). At a spherical UME of radius $r_{0}, m_{\mathrm{O}}=D_{\mathrm{O}} / r_{0}$. At a disk UME of radius $r_{0}, m_{\mathrm{O}}=4 D_{\mathrm{O}} / \pi r_{0}$ (Section 5.2.5).

[^16]:    30 Here we use $E^{0^{\prime}}$, called the formal potential, rather than the standard potential, $E^{0}$. The formal potential is an adjusted form of the standard potential, manifesting activity coefficients and some chemical effects of the medium. In Section 2.1.7, it will be introduced in more detail. For the present it is not necessary to distinguish between $E^{0^{\prime}}$ and $E^{0}$.

[^17]:    31 We will see in Chapter 3 that oxidation and reduction can indeed be widely separated on the potential axis, but for kinetic reasons, not for anything to do with $E^{0^{\prime}}$.
    32 This will not be the case for R plated onto an inert substrate in amounts less than a monolayer (e.g., the substrate electrode being Pt and R being Cu ). Under those conditions, the activity of R may be considerably less than unity.

[^18]:    33 Sometimes called the concentration overpotential.
    34. Since $\eta$ is a measure of polarization, this condition is sometimes called complete mass-transfer polarization or complete concentration polarization.

[^19]:    35 A similar (but not identical) treatment gives $\eta_{\mathrm{mt}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{mt}}$ for any system in which an equilibrium potential is defined, e.g., when both O and R are soluble and present in the bulk, as in Section 1.3.2(b). In general, $R_{\mathrm{mt}}=[-d i / d E]_{E=E_{\mathrm{eq}}}^{-1}$.
    36 To simplify notation, charges on all species are omitted.

[^20]:    37 When the mechanism was introduced above, the free metal ion was assumed to be electroactive and the complex to be electroinactive. Thinking this way simplifies a first discussion of this topic; however, the assumption is unnecessary. Since the metal ion and the complex remain in equilibrium, it is not possible to discern which species is the primary electroreactant. Mechanistic information is not available when thermodynamic equilibrium always applies.

[^21]:    38 The sign preceding the ohmic drop in (1.5.1) is negative because of the sign convention adopted here for currents (cathodic currents taken as positive).

[^22]:    39 Even though one sees no slope to the profile inside any of the metallic phases in Figure 1.5.2, each such segment must have an upward slope to the right, because the metals also have resistance to current flow. However, their ohmic drops are invisible on the scale of the figure, because the metals are much more conductive than the electrolytes.

[^23]:    40 This is a moment to remind the reader that the focus of this book is on electrochemical characterization methods carried out in lab-sized cells. The comments here are in keeping with that focus. Two-electrode cells are used extensively in industrial and technological situations, including synthetic cells, batteries, and fuel cells. In many of these cases, $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is a large, sometimes dominant, part of the total voltage between the electrodes. Optimization of electrode potentials in such systems is beyond the scope of this book.
    41 Or auxiliary electrode.

[^24]:    42 In an actual experimental arrangement, two electrodes and two interfaces, would have to be considered; however, we concentrate our attention here on one interface and ignore what happens at the other.
    43 In various equations in the literature and in this book, $C_{d}$ may express the capacitance per unit area and be given in $\mu \mathrm{F} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, or it may express the capacitance of a whole interface and be given in $\mu \mathrm{F}$. The usage for a given situation is always apparent from the context or from a dimensional analysis.

[^25]:    44 Nonspecific adsorption is a well-established term in the literature, but it can lead to confusion. Actually, nonspecifically adsorbed ions are not adsorbed at all within the meaning usually attached to the idea of adsorption, which involves chemical binding of an adsorbate to a surface. In electrochemistry, nonspecifically adsorbed ions are said to be "adsorbed" because they are in excess in the interfacial region.
    45 In the example just given, the potential at the OHP is -21 mV vs. bulk solution; thus, each electronic state on a molecule or ion at the OHP is 21 meV higher in energy than for the same species in bulk solution. This makes the species at the OHP a little easier to oxidize or a little harder to reduce. That 21 meV is about equal to $k T$ (the Boltzmann constant times absolute temperature, 25.7 meV at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), so it is big enough to produce noticeable kinetic effects in situations where precise rate constants are meaningful, but it is not so big as to be of concern when only the magnitude of kinetic data is being sought.
    46 Double-layer structure can even affect the thermodynamics of a redox couple if the members of the couple are confined to the electrode surface, as in the case of an electroactive adsorbate.
    47 Actually, the capacitance of the SCE, $C_{\text {SCE }}$, must also be included. The total series capacitance of $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ and $C_{\text {SCE }}$ is $C_{\mathrm{T}}=C_{\mathrm{d}} C_{\text {SCE }} /\left(C_{\mathrm{d}}+C_{\text {SCE }}\right)$. Normally the SCE would be designed to have a much larger area, so that $C_{\text {SCE }} \gg C_{\mathrm{d}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{T}} \approx C_{\mathrm{d}}$. Thus, $C_{\mathrm{SCE}}$ can be neglected in the circuit.
    48 Since $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ at a real electrode is generally a function of potential, the proposed model in terms of circuit elements is strictly accurate only for experiments where the overall cell potential does not change very much. Where it does, approximate results can be obtained using an average $C_{d}$ over the potential range.

[^26]:    49 The first and second editions also cover the case in which a constant current is applied.

[^27]:    50 A corollary is that the potential drop across the working electrode/electrolyte interface is generally not zero when a zero potential vs. the reference electrode is applied.
    51 This $q$ is the same as $q^{\mathrm{M}}$ above. Charge is frequently discussed from the perspective of the working electrode and symbolized without the superscript.

[^28]:    52 Equation (1.6.12) is general for both two-electrode and three-electrode cells. In the former case, $R_{\mathrm{u}}=R_{\mathrm{s}}$.
    53 This can be viewed as the same result as in (1.6.6). For that case, $R_{\mathrm{u}}=R_{\mathrm{s}}$, and $\Delta E=E$.

[^29]:    54 In this book and most of the literature, the scan rate, $v$, is an absolute quantity, having no sign. Scan direction is reflected by explicit signs in equations. Equation (1.6.19) describes a negative-going scan.

[^30]:    55 The idea of a background current was introduced in Section 1.1.7(b). In most experiments, it is the sum of a charging current plus faradaic currents from the solvent, supporting electrolyte, electrode material, or impurities. Near the background limits, faradaic currents from primary components of the system predominate, but between the background limits, there may be a region where the background current is mainly charging current.

[^31]:    56 The time scale of an experiment is an important concept that we will encounter repeatedly. It refers generally to the time period over which the most important data are recorded. For example, it might be taken as the duration of measurements after a potential step or the time required to sweep across a voltammetric wave. If the working electrode potential is to accurately follow time variations in $E_{\text {appl }}$, the cell time constant must be significantly shorter than the experimental time scale.

They are cited below with all editors who have ever been engaged, in order of appearance, and with the publisher of the most recent volume. Individual volumes may have involved a subset of the listed editors or a different publisher. 58 Articles in the series numbered 1, 2, 4, and 7 are cited in this book, and often elsewhere in the literature, in journal reference format with the abbreviations Adv.

[^33]:    59 A potentiostat can also be used with a two-electrode cell. In that case, the leads for both the counter and reference electrodes are connected to the reference.
