# 1.5 Cell Resistance and the Measurement of Potential

Let us now consider a cell composed of two ideally nonpolarizable electrodes, for example, two SCEs immersed in a potassium chloride solution: SCE/KCl/SCE. The $i-E$ characteristic of the ideal cell would look like that of a pure resistance (Figure 1.5.1, solid line), because the only limitation on current flow is imposed by the resistance of the solution. In fact, these conditions (i.e., paired nonpolarizable electrodes) are exactly those sought in measurements of solution conductivity. For any real electrodes (e.g., actual SCEs), mass-transfer and charge-transfer overpotentials would also become significant at high enough current densities.

Figure 1.5.1 Current-potential curve for a cell composed of two electrodes approaching ideal nonpolarizability. The magnitude of the slope is $1 / R_{s^{\prime}}$, where $R_{s}$ is the solution resistance.

When the potential of any electrode is measured against a reference electrode during the passage of current, a voltage drop equal to $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ (often called the ohmic drop) is always included in the measured value. Here, $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the solution resistance between the electrodes, which, unlike the impedances describing the mass transfer and activation steps in the electrode reaction, actually behaves as a true resistance over a wide range of conditions.
The inclusion of ohmic drop in measurements of potential has broad impact on electrochemical experiments, so we must begin to explore it in detail.

### 1.5.1 Components of the Applied Voltage When Current Flows

Consider once again the cell in Figure 1.2.4. At open circuit ( $i=0$ ), the potential of the cadmium electrode is the equilibrium value, $E_{\text {eq,Cd }}$ (about -0.64 V vs. SCE). We saw earlier that with $E_{\text {appl }}=-0.64 \mathrm{~V}\left(\mathrm{Cd}\right.$ vs. SCE), no current would flow through the ammeter. If $E_{\text {appl }}$ is changed to $-0.80 \mathrm{~V}(\mathrm{Cd}$ vs. SCE), current flows. The extra applied voltage is distributed in two parts. First, to deliver the current, the potential of the Cd electrode, $E_{\mathrm{Cd}}$, must shift to a new value, perhaps -0.70 V vs. SCE. The remainder of the applied voltage ( -0.10 V in this example) represents the ohmic drop caused by current flow in solution. We assume that the SCE is essentially ideally nonpolarizable and does not change its potential under current flow.
In general,

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\text {appl }}(v s . \mathrm{SCE})=E_{\mathrm{Cd}}(v s . \mathrm{SCE})-i R_{\mathrm{s}}=E_{\mathrm{eq}, \mathrm{Cd}}(v s . \mathrm{SCE})+\eta-i R_{\mathrm{s}} \tag{1.5.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

in which the last two terms are related to current flow. When there is a cathodic current at the working (cadmium) electrode, both are negative. Conversely, both are positive for an anodic current. An overpotential (the total from all sources; Section 1.2.3), $\eta=E_{\mathrm{Cd}}-E_{\mathrm{eq}, \mathrm{Cd}}$, is needed to drive the electrode reaction at the rate corresponding to the current. In the example above, $\eta=-0.06 \mathrm{~V}$. The ohmic drop, $-i R_{\mathrm{s}}$, exists to deliver the net current through the electrolyte. ${ }^{38}$
The profile of electrostatic potential along the current path is illustrated in Figure 1.5.2, which resembles Figure 1.1.2, discussed earlier. In the prior case, the system was at open circuit, so there was no current flow. The potential inside each conducting phase was constant, and

Distance along current path

Figure 1.5.2 Profile of electrostatic potential, $\phi$, along the current path in the cell of Figure 1.2.4. Cu and $\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}$ represent the wires used to connect apparatus to the cell (as in Figure 1.1.4). The cell has two compartments, with the working electrode and the reference electrode having different electrolytes. A porous, ionically conducting separator, such as a frit, prevents mixing of the electrolytes. The slope of the potential profile differs in the two electrolytes because their conductivities are not the same.
changes in potential occurred only at the interfaces. In Figure 1.5.2, the potential inside the electrolyte phases is not constant, but slopes upward from the working electrode to the reference. This is a consequence of the current flow. The potential difference across the electrolyte (the working side vs. the reference side) is the ohmic drop. Inside the electrolyte, anions are driven along a sloping potential profile in the upward direction, and cations are driven in the downward direction. ${ }^{39}$

In this cell, different electrolytes are in contact with the working and reference electrodes. They must contact each other in a manner that permits ionic exchange (e.g., through a glass frit). This contact is called a liquid junction and is marked in Figure 1.5.2 with a vertical gray line. Because a liquid junction is a boundary between conducting phases, one must generally expect a discontinuity in electrostatic potential (called a liquid junction potential), like the stairstep at any of the other boundaries. Section 2.3 covers liquid junctions in detail, and we will see there that good design can often reduce a junction potential to a negligible level for most electrochemical work. Such is the case for Figure 1.5.2. The double slash in the corresponding cell notation in Figure 1.2.4 indicates a liquid junction that does not contribute to the overall cell potential.

In (1.5.1), the ohmic drop is separately identified from the overpotential, because it is characteristic of the bulk solution and not of the working electrode/electrolyte interface or the electrode reaction. Unfortunately, its existence in $E_{\text {appl }}$ weakens our strategy for controlling the potential at a working electrode/electrolyte interface vs. a reference. Our real interest is in the actual potential of the Cd electrode vs. the reference, i.e., $E_{\mathrm{Cd}}$, which is corrected for $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$.

While $E_{\mathrm{Cd}}$ is the fundamentally important quantity, dictating the identity and rates of electrode reactions at the working electrode, $E_{\text {appl }}$ is what one can actually measure and control. In most experiments, $E_{\text {appl }}$ is the intended working electrode potential (perhaps varying in a chosen way with time), so it is generally desirable to work under conditions in which the actual working electrode potential approaches $E_{\text {appl }}$ as closely as possible, i.e., with ohmic drop minimized. Proper cell design and instrumentation are the keys to success.

### 1.5.2 Two-Electrode Cells

Under conditions where $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is less than a few mV and the reference electrode remains unpolarized under the current flow, a two-electrode cell (Figure 1.5.3) can be used to determine the $i-E$ curve, just as we have been discussing. The potential of the working electrode can be taken from $E_{\text {appl }}$, either directly or with correction for the small ohmic drop. In classic experiments in aqueous solutions, two-electrode cells were often used. In these systems, it was often true that $i<10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $R_{\mathrm{s}}<100 \Omega$, so that $i R_{\mathrm{s}}<10^{-5} \mathrm{~A} \times 100 \Omega$ or $i R_{\mathrm{s}}<1 \mathrm{mV}$, which is negligible for most purposes. In contemporary practice with UMEs, it has become common to employ two-electrode cells, because the currents are extremely small and $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is typically insignificant. Figure 1.5.4a shows a typical two-electrode cell for work with a UME.

With larger electrodes (even in the millimeter range) or with more highly resistive solutions, such as those based on many nonaqueous solvents or with low concentrations of supporting electrolyte, serious complications can result from the ohmic drop in solution. In these situations, a three-electrode cell is used, as discussed in Section 1.5.3. ${ }^{40}$

### 1.5.3 Three-Electrode Cells

In experiments where $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is too large for two-electrode cells to be effective (e.g., with high-current cells or nonaqueous electrolytes having low conductivities), a three-electrode cell (Figure 1.5.5) is preferable. In this arrangement, the current is passed between the working electrode and a counter electrode, ${ }^{41}$ while the potential is measured against a separate reference electrode that need not carry any cell current. The counter electrode can be any convenient one, because its electrochemical properties do not affect the measurements or the behavior of the electrode of interest. It might be chosen to be an electrode that does not produce

substances by electrolysis that will reach the working electrode surface and cause interfering reactions there. Frequently, it is placed in a compartment separated from the working electrode by an ionically conducting separator. The reference electrode is positioned with its tip near the working electrode for reasons that we will shortly discuss. An example of a three-electrode cell is shown in Figure 1.5.4b.

The device used to measure the potential difference between the working electrode and the reference electrode has a high input impedance, so that a negligible current is drawn through the reference electrode. Consequently, its potential will remain constant and equal to its open-circuit value.

In a three-electrode cell, $E_{\text {appl }}$ is the voltage of the working electrode vs. the reference, just as in two-electrode cells, and remains the measured/controlled quantity in most experiments.

This three-electrode arrangement is widely used for electrochemical experiments. An instrument that manifests the electrical capabilities in Figure 1.5.5 is called a potentiostat (Section 1.9.1 and Chapter 16).

### 1.5.4 Uncompensated Resistance

In the three-electrode arrangement, the $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ term is partly-sometimes even largely-removed from the measured potential of the working electrode. However, it is not entirely removed. Consider the potential profile in solution between the working and counter electrodes, shown schematically in Figure 1.5.6. (The profile in an actual cell depends on the electrode shapes, geometry, solution conductance, etc.) The solution between the electrodes can be regarded as a potentiometer (often a highly nonlinear one). If the reference electrode is placed anywhere but exactly at the electrode surface, some fraction of $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$, (denoted as $i R_{\mathrm{u}}$, where $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ is the uncompensated resistance) will be included in the measured potential. The good news is that the larger part of $i R_{\mathrm{s}}$ has been removed from the measured potential (i.e., has been "compensated") by

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/39e25d6e-3e26-41a2-837f-c97e3e086a0a-39.jpg?height=579&width=811&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=203)

employing the three-electrode configuration. The compensated resistance is denoted in this book as $R_{\mathrm{c}}$, so that $R_{\mathrm{u}}+R_{\mathrm{c}}=R_{\mathrm{s}}$.
Even when the reference electrode is designed for very close placement to the working electrode by use of a fine tip called a Luggin-Haber capillary, some uncompensated resistance remains. The uncompensated potential drop can sometimes be removed separately, e.g., from steady-state measurements by measurement of $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ and point-by-point correction of each value of potential. Electrochemical instrumentation frequently includes provisions for electronic compensation of $i R_{\mathrm{u}}$ (Chapter 16).
One can think of a three-electrode cell as comprising two distinct cells, a reference cell and a current-carrying cell, having the working electrode in common. Figure 1.5.7 shows the potential profiles through both component cells of a system in which the working electrode is $\mathrm{Cd} / \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(5 \mathrm{mM}), \mathrm{KNO}_{3}(1 \mathrm{M})$ and the reference electrode is an SCE (as in Figures 1.2.4 and 1.5.2), while the counter electrode is Pt in $1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$. The reference cell is therefore

Distance along current path

Figure 1.5.7 Potential profiles across a three-electrode cell. Solid profile describes the current-carrying cell (working and counter electrodes). Dashed gray lines show components of the reference electrode. Working and reference electrodes make up the reference cell. At the black circle on the left, the reference electrode tip makes connection to the potential profile in the current-carrying cell. The liquid junction between working and counter electrode compartments is at the porous separator on the right. $\mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{Cu}^{\prime \prime}$ are copper wires contacting the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively.
$\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Cd} / \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(5 \mathrm{mM}), \mathrm{KNO}_{3}(1 \mathrm{M}) / / \mathrm{KCl}$ (sat'd) $/ \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime}$, and the current-carrying cell is $\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Cd} / \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(5 \mathrm{mM}), \mathrm{KNO}_{3}(1 \mathrm{M}) / / \mathrm{HNO}_{3}(1 \mathrm{M}) / \mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{Cu}^{\prime \prime}$. The liquid junction between the tip of the reference electrode and the working solution is close to the working electrode, as shown in Figure 1.5.7.

The potential profile in the electrolyte inside the reference electrode is flat, because there is only a tiny current flow through the reference electrode; however, the reference cell still includes part of the overall ohmic drop in the current-carrying cell ( $-i R_{\mathrm{u}}$ ), because the reference and current-carrying cells share the solution segment between the working electrode and the reference cell's contact point.

The potential profiles in the electrolytes of the current-carrying cell slope upward to the right, because current moves along the whole path. The total ohmic drop across this cell is $-i R_{\mathrm{s}}$, several times larger than $-i R_{\mathrm{u}}$.

The measured potential of the working electrode would be determined vs. the SCE (as $E_{\text {appl }}$ ), and the actual potential, $E$, would be given by correction for the uncompensated ohmic drop:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E_{\mathrm{appl}}+i R_{\mathrm{u}} \tag{1.5.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is also valid for a two-electrode system. In that case, the full solution resistance across the cell is uncompensated; thus, $R_{\mathrm{c}}=0$ and $R_{\mathrm{u}}=R_{\mathrm{s}}$.

If the reference capillary has a tip diameter $d$, it can be placed as close as $2 d$ from the working electrode surface without causing appreciable shielding error, where shielding denotes a partial blockage of the current path in solution, modifying the current densities at the working electrode surface.

For a planar electrode with uniform current density across its surface,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{u}}=x / \kappa A \tag{1.5.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $x$ is the distance of the capillary tip from the electrode, $A$ is the electrode area, and $\kappa$ is the solution conductivity.

The effect of $i R_{\mathrm{u}}$ can be particularly serious for spherical microelectrodes, such as the hanging mercury drop electrode or the dropping mercury electrode (DME), because most of the resistive drop occurs close to the electrode. For a spherical electrode of radius $r_{0}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{u}}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \kappa r_{0}}\left(\frac{x}{x+r_{0}}\right) \tag{1.5.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

For a reference electrode tip placed just one electrode radius away $\left(x=r_{0}\right), R_{\mathrm{u}}$ is already half of the value for the tip placed infinitely far away.

Any resistance in the working electrode itself (e.g., in thin wires used to make ultramicroelectrodes, in semiconductor electrodes, or in resistive films on the electrode surface) will also appear in $R_{\mathrm{u}}$.

In this section, we have come to see how uncompensated ohmic drop is included in the measured or controlled potential of the working electrode; however, there is more to the story. In the next section, we will see that $R_{\mathrm{u}}$ is also a determining factor in the time response of an electrochemical cell.
