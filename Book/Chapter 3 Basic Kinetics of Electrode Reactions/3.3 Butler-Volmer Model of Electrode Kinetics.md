# 3.3 Butler-Volmer Model of Electrode Kinetics

Experience demonstrates that the potential of an electrode strongly affects the kinetics of reactions occurring on its surface. Hydrogen evolves rapidly at some potentials, but not at others. Copper dissolves from a metallic sample in a clearly defined potential range; yet, the metal is stable at more negative potentials. And so it is for all faradaic processes. Because the interfacial potential difference can be used to control reactivity, we want to understand the precise way in which $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ depend on potential. In this section, we will develop a predictive model based purely on classical concepts (8-19). Even though it has significant limitations, it is very widely used in the electrochemical literature and must be understood by any student of the field. Section 3.5 will cover more fundamental models based on microscopic ideas about electron transfer.

## 3.3.1 Effects of Potential on Energy Barriers

We saw in Section 3.1 that reactions can be visualized in terms of progress along a reaction coordinate connecting a reactant configuration to a product configuration on an energy surface. This idea applies to electrode reactions too, but the shape of the energy surface becomes a function of electrode potential.

One can see the effect easily by considering the following reaction at a mercury electrode,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e \stackrel{\mathrm{Hg}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{Hg}) \tag{3.3.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{Hg})$ represents sodium amalgam, and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is dissolved in acetonitrile or DMF. If we think of the reaction coordinate as the distance of the sodium nucleus from the interface; then the free-energy profile along the reaction coordinate would resemble Figure 3.3.1a. To the right is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e$. This configuration has an energy that depends little on the nuclear position in solution unless the electrode is approached so closely that the ion must become partially or wholly desolvated. To the left, the configuration corresponds to a sodium atom dissolved in mercury. Within the mercury phase, the energy does not depend on position, but if the atom leaves the interior, its energy rises as the favorable mercury-sodium interaction is lost. The curves corresponding to these reactant and product configurations intersect at the transition state, and the heights of the barriers to oxidation and reduction determine the relative rates of those processes. When the rates are equal, as in Figure 3.3.1a, the system is at equilibrium, and the potential is $E_{\text {eq }}$.

Now suppose the electrode potential is changed to a more positive value. The main effect is to lower the energy of the "reactant" electron, which resides on the electrode. The curve corresponding to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e$ drops with respect to that corresponding to $\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{Hg})$, and the situation resembles that of Figure 3.3.1b. The barrier for reduction is raised and that for oxidation is lowered, so there is a net conversion of $\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{Hg})$ to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e$.

Setting the potential to a value more negative than $E_{\text {eq }}$ raises the energy of the electron and shifts the curve for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e$ to higher energies, as shown in Figure 3.3.1c. Since the reduction barrier drops and the oxidation barrier rises, relative to the condition at $E_{\text {eq }}$, a net cathodic current flows.

These arguments show qualitatively how the potential affects the net rates and directions of electrode reactions. By considering the model more closely, we can establish a quantitative theory.

## 3.3.2 One-Step, One-Electron Process

Let us now consider the simplest possible electrode process, wherein two solutes, O and R , engage in a one-electron transfer at the interface without being involved in any other chemical step,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+e \underset{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{\stackrel{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftarrows}} \mathrm{R} \tag{3.3.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

Suppose also that the standard free-energy profiles along the reaction coordinate have the parabolic shapes shown in Figure 3.3.2. The upper frame of that figure depicts the full path from reactants to products, while the lower frame is an enlargement of the region near the transition state. It is not important for this discussion that we know the shapes of these profiles in detail.

In developing a theory of electrode kinetics, it is convenient to express the potential, $E$, vs. a point of significance to the chemistry of the system, rather than vs. an arbitrary

external reference, such as an $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrode. There are two natural reference points: the equilibrium potential of the system and the standard (or formal) potential of the couple under consideration. Indeed, we used the equilibrium potential as a reference point in the discussion of the Section 3.3.1, and we will use it again below. However, it is possible to do so only when both members of the couple are present, so that an equilibrium is defined. The more general reference point is $E^{0^{\prime}}$. Suppose the upper curve on the $\mathrm{O}+e$ side of Figure 3.3.2 applies when the electrode potential is equal to $E^{0^{\prime}}$. The corresponding cathodic and anodic activation energies are $\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{c}}^{\ddagger}$ and $\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger}$, respectively.

If the potential is changed to a new value, $E$, the energy per mole of the electrons resident on the electrode changes by $-F \Delta E=-F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$; hence, the $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve moves up or down by

that amount. ${ }^{5}$ The lower curve on the left side of Figure 3.3.2 shows this effect for a positive $\Delta E$. The barrier for oxidation, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger}$, has clearly become less than $\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger}$ by a fraction of the total energy change. Let us call that fraction $1-\alpha$, where $\alpha$, the transfer coefficient, can range from zero to unity. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger}=\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger}-(1-\alpha) F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) \tag{3.3.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

Study of Figure 3.3.2 also reveals that the cathodic barrier at potential $E, \Delta G_{c}^{\ddagger}$, is higher than $\Delta G_{0 c}^{\ddagger}$ by the amount $\alpha F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$; therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{c}}^{\ddagger}=\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{c}}^{\ddagger}+\alpha F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) \tag{3.3.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

Now let us assume that the rate constants $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ have an Arrhenius form:

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=A_{\mathrm{f}} e^{-\Delta G_{\mathrm{c}}^{\ddagger} / R T}  \tag{3.3.5a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=A_{\mathrm{b}} e^{-\Delta G_{\mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger} / R T} \tag{3.3.5b}
\end{align*}
$$

[^4]Inserting the activation energies, (3.3.3) and (3.3.4), gives

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=A_{\mathrm{f}} e^{-\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{c}}^{\ddagger} / R T} e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}  \tag{3.3.6a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=A_{\mathrm{b}} e^{-\Delta G_{0 \mathrm{a}}^{\ddagger} / R T} e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.3.6b}
\end{align*}
$$

where $f=F / R T$. In each of these expressions, the first two factors form a product that is both independent of potential and equal to the corresponding rate constant at $E=E^{0^{\prime}}$. 6

Now let us think about the special case in which the interface is at equilibrium with a solution in which $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}=C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$. In this situation, $E=E^{0^{\prime}}, C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)=C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$, and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)=C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$. Because equilibrium applies, $i=0$. Consequently, $k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}=k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$, and $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ must equal $k_{\mathrm{b}}$. We now see that $E^{0^{\prime}}$ is the potential where the forward and reverse rate constants have the same value, called the standard rate constant, $k^{0} .^{7}$ Although we used a special case to discover this point, the rate constants do not depend on concentration; hence, the equality of $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ at $E^{0^{\prime}}$ holds for all concentrations. In fact, we made this discovery without using any detail concerning $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ or $k_{\mathrm{b}} .{ }^{8}$ Only the principles of mass action were involved. The fact that $k_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{b}}=k^{0}$ at $E^{0^{\prime}}$ depends only on the form of the electrochemical reaction given in (3.3.2).

The rate constants at other potentials can now be expressed simply in terms of $k^{0}$ :

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=k^{0} e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}  \tag{3.3.7a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=k^{0} e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.3.7b}
\end{align*}
$$

Insertion of these relations into (3.2.8) yields the current-potential characteristic:

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=F A k^{0}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}-C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}\right] \tag{3.3.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

This relation is very important. It, or a variation derived from it, is used in the treatment of a great many situations requiring an account of heterogeneous kinetics. Section 3.4 will cover some of its ramifications. The results in (3.3.7) and (3.3.8) and the inferences derived from them are known broadly as the Butler-Volmer (BV) formulation of electrode kinetics, in honor of the pioneers in this area $(20,21)$.

One can derive the BV kinetic expressions by an alternate method based on electrochemical potentials $(13,14,16,22-24)$. Such an approach can be more convenient for more complicated cases, such as those requiring the inclusion of double-layer effects. The first edition developed it in detail. ${ }^{9}$

## 3.3.3 The Standard Rate Constant

The physical interpretation of $k^{0}$ is straightforward: It is a measure of the heterogeneous kinetic facility of a redox couple. A system with a large $k^{0}$ can achieve equilibrium quickly, but a system with small $k^{0}$ is sluggish.

[^5]The largest standard rate constants measured to date are in the range of 10-40 cm/s (25-31) and relate to $\mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{2+}$ and various ferrocenium/ferrocene couples. Also very facile are $\operatorname{Ru}(\text { bpy })_{3}^{3+} / \operatorname{Ru}(\text { bpy })_{3}^{2+}$ and many couples linking large aromatic hydrocarbons to their anion and cation radicals. All of these processes involve only electron transfer and resolvation. There are no significant alterations in the molecular frames. Similarly, some electrode reactions involving the formation of amalgams [e.g., the couples $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{Hg}), \mathrm{Cd}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{Hg})$, and $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+} / \mathrm{Hg}$ ] are kinetically facile (32, 33). In contrast, heterogeneous reactions involving significant molecular rearrangement upon electron transfer, such as the reduction of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide or water, or the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen, can be very sluggish (7, 8, 32-34). Systems like these typically involve multistep mechanisms (Section 3.7; Chapters 13 and 15). Values of $k^{0}$ significantly lower than $10^{-9} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$ have been reported ( 35,36 ); hence, electrochemistry deals with a range of more than 10 orders of magnitude in kinetic reactivity.

Note from (3.3.7) that $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ can be made quite large, even if $k^{0}$ is small, by using a sufficiently extreme potential relative to $E^{0^{\prime}}$. In effect, one drives the reaction by lowering the activation energy electrically. This idea is explored more fully in Section 3.4.

## 3.3.4 The Transfer Coefficient

In the Butler-Volmer kinetic model, the transfer coefficient, $\alpha$, is assumed to be independent of potential. Like $k^{0}$, it is a fixed parameter that depends on the chemical identity of the system.

The transfer coefficient is a measure of the symmetry of the energy barrier for a single electron-transfer step. ${ }^{10}$ Let us develop this idea in terms of the geometry of the intersection region, as shown in Figure 3.3.3. If the free-energy curves are locally linear, then the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ are defined by

$$
\begin{align*}
& \tan \theta=\alpha F E / x  \tag{3.3.9a}\\
& \tan \phi=(1-\alpha) F E / x \tag{3.3.9b}
\end{align*}
$$

Figure 3.3.4 The transfer coefficient as an indicator of the symmetry of the barrier to reaction. The dashed lines show the shift in the curve for $\mathrm{O}+e$ as the potential is made more positive.

Hence,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\alpha=\frac{\tan \theta}{\tan \phi+\tan \theta} \tag{3.3.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the intersection is symmetrical, $\phi=\theta$, and $\alpha=1 / 2$. Otherwise $0 \leq \alpha<1 / 2$ or $\frac{1}{2}<\alpha \leq 1$, as shown in Figure 3.3.4. In most experimental cases, $\alpha$ turns out to lie between 0.3 and 0.7, and is often taken to be 0.5 in the absence of actual measurements.

The assumption in the BV model that $\alpha$ is constant with potential is equivalent to assuming linear free-energy curves, so that the geometry of intersection never changes with potential. Since real free-energy profiles are likely to be nonlinear over large ranges of the reaction coordinate, the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ can be expected to change as the intersection between the reactant and product curves shifts with potential. Consequently, one must generally expect $\alpha$ to be a potential-dependent factor.

Nevertheless, $\alpha$ actually appears constant in most experiments, if only because the potential range over which kinetic data can be collected is often fairly narrow. The intersection point corresponding to accessible measurements then varies only over a small domain, such as the boxed region in Figure 3.3.2, where the curvature in the (parabolic) profiles can hardly be seen. The usable potential range is limited because the rate constant for electron transfer rises exponentially with potential. Not far beyond the potential where a process first produces a detectable current, mass transfer becomes rate limiting, and the electron-transfer kinetics no longer control the experiment. The competition between kinetics and mass transfer will be encountered throughout the remainder of this book.

Other models for heterogeneous electron transfer (Section 3.5) do predict a potentialdependent transfer coefficient. In systems where electron-transfer kinetics can be measured over very wide ranges of potential, sizable variations of $\alpha$ with potential can be seen [Section 3.5.4(c)].
