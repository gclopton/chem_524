# 3.4 Implications of the Butler-Volmer Model for the One-Step, One-Electron Process

In this section, we develop operational relationships that will prove valuable in the interpretation of electrochemical experiments. Each is derived under the assumption that the electrode reaction is the simple one-step, one-electron process for which primary relations were derived above. Multistep processes, involving additional electron transfers or chemical steps, are more complicated, and the findings of this section cannot be assumed to apply to them. They are treated in Section 3.7 and Chapters 13 and 15.

## 3.4.1 Equilibrium Conditions and the Exchange Current

At equilibrium, the net current is zero, and the electrode is known to adopt a potential based on the bulk concentrations of O and R as dictated by the Nernst equation (Section 2.1.6). Let us see now if the kinetic model yields that thermodynamic relation as a special case. From (3.3.8) we have, at zero current,

$$
\begin{equation*}
F A k^{0} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}=F A k^{0} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.4.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since equilibrium applies, surface concentrations do not differ from those of the bulk; hence, upon substitution and rearrangement, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} \tag{3.4.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is an exponential form of the Nernst relation:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{eq}}=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} \tag{3.4.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

The theory has passed its first test.
Even though the net current is zero at equilibrium, we still envision balanced faradaic activity that can be expressed in terms of the exchange current, $i_{0}$, which is equal in magnitude to either component current, $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ or $i_{\mathrm{a}}$. Using $i_{\mathrm{c}}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{0}=F A k^{0} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*} e^{-\alpha f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.4.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

If both sides of (3.4.2) are raised to the $-\alpha$ power, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{-\alpha f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}=\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}\right)^{-\alpha} \tag{3.4.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Substitution of (3.4.5) into (3.4.4) gives ${ }^{11}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{0}=F A k^{0} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*(1-\alpha)} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{* \alpha} \tag{3.4.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

The exchange current is proportional to $k^{0}$ and can often be substituted for $k^{0}$ in kinetic equations. For the case where $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}=C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}=C^{*}$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{0}=F A k^{0} C^{*} \tag{3.4.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

Often the exchange current is normalized to unit area to provide the exchange current density, $j_{0}=i_{0} / A$.

## 3.4.2 The Current-Overpotential Equation

An advantage of working with $i_{0}$ rather than $k^{0}$ is that the current can be described in terms of the deviation from the equilibrium potential, rather than the formal potential, $E^{0^{\prime}}$. Dividing (3.3.8) by (3.4.6), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*(1-\alpha)} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{* \alpha}}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*(1-\alpha)} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{* \alpha}} \tag{3.4.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

11 The same equation can be derived from $i_{\mathrm{a}}$.

Figure 3.4.1 Current-overpotential curves for the system $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ with $\alpha=0.5, T=298 \mathrm{~K}, i_{l, \mathrm{c}}=-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}=i_{l}$ and $i_{0} / i_{I}=0.2$. The dashed lines show the component currents, $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $i_{\mathrm{a}}$.

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}} e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}\right)^{\alpha}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}\right)^{-(1-\alpha)} \tag{3.4.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

The ratios $\left(C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*} / C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\right)^{\alpha}$ and $\left(C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*} / C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\right)^{-(1-\alpha)}$ are easily evaluated from (3.4.2) and (3.4.5), and by substitution we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0}\left[\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}} e^{-\alpha f \eta}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}\right] \tag{3.4.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\eta=E-E_{\mathrm{eq}}$. This equation, known as the current-overpotential equation, will be used frequently in later discussions. The first term describes the cathodic component current at any potential, and the second gives the anodic contribution. ${ }^{12}$

The behavior predicted by (3.4.10) is displayed in Figure 3.4.1, where the solid curve shows the actual total current, which is the sum of the components $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $i_{\mathrm{a}}$, shown as dashed traces. For large negative $\eta$, the anodic component is negligible; hence, the total current curve merges with that for $i_{\mathrm{c}}$. At large positive $\eta$, the cathodic component is negligible, and the total current is essentially the same as $i_{\mathrm{a}}$. Going in either direction from $E_{\mathrm{eq}}$, the magnitude of the current rises rapidly, because the exponential factors dominate behavior, but at extreme $\eta$, the current levels off. In these level regions, the current is limited by mass transfer rather than heterogeneous kinetics. The exponentials in (3.4.10) become moderated by the factors $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$, which manifest the reactant supply (Section 3.4.6).

[^7]
## 3.4.3 Approximate Forms of the $\boldsymbol{i}-\boldsymbol{\eta}$ Equation

### (a) No Mass-Transfer Effects

If the solution is well stirred, or currents are kept so low that the surface concentrations do not differ appreciably from the bulk values, then (3.4.10) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0}\left[e^{-\alpha f \eta}-e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}\right] \tag{3.4.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is historically known as the Butler-Volmer equation. It is a good approximation of (3.4.10) when $i$ is less than about $10 \%$ of the smaller limiting current, $i_{l, \mathrm{c}}$ or $\left|i_{l, \mathrm{a}}\right|$. Equations 1.4.10 and 1.4.19 show that $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ will then be between 0.9 and 1.1.

Figure 3.4.2 shows the behavior of (3.4.11) for systems in which the exchange current densities differ, but $\alpha=0.5$ consistently. The notable feature is the degree to which the inflection at $E_{\text {eq }}$ depends on the exchange current density. Figure 3.4.3 illustrates the effect of $\alpha$ in a similar manner for cases in which the exchange current density remains the same.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-15.jpg?height=577&width=1030&top_left_y=894&top_left_x=203)

(a) $j_{0}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ (curve is indistinguishable from the current axis), (b) $j_{0}=10^{-6} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, (c) $j_{0}=10^{-9} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. For all cases the reaction is $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ with $\alpha=0.5, T=298 \mathrm{~K}$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-15.jpg?height=577&width=1026&top_left_y=1636&top_left_x=203)
Figure 3.4.3 Effect of the transfer coefficient on the symmetry of the current-overpotential curves for $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ with $T=298 \mathrm{~K}$ and $j_{0}=10^{-6} \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

Since mass-transfer effects are not included here, the overpotential associated with any given current serves solely to alter the activation energy as required to drive the heterogeneous process at the rate reflected by the current. The smaller the exchange current, the more sluggish the kinetics; hence, the larger this activation overpotential must be for any given net current.

If the exchange current is large, as for Figure 3.4.2a, then the system can supply large currents, even the mass-transfer-limited current, with insignificant activation overpotential. In that case, any observed overpotential is associated with changing surface concentrations of species O and R . It is called a mass-transfer overpotential and reflects the activation energy required to drive mass transfer at the rate needed to support the current. If the concentrations of O and R are comparable, then $E_{\text {eq }}$ will be near $E^{0^{\prime}}$, and the limiting currents for both the anodic and cathodic segments will be reached within a few tens of millivolts of $E^{0^{\prime}}$.

On the other hand, one might have a system with an exceedingly small exchange current, because $k^{0}$ is very low, as for Figure 3.4.2c. In that circumstance, no significant current flows unless a large activation overpotential is applied. At a sufficiently extreme potential, the heterogeneous process can be driven fast enough that mass transfer controls the current, and a limiting plateau is reached. When mass-transfer effects start to manifest themselves, a concentration overpotential will also contribute, but the bulk of the overpotential will be for activation of charge transfer. In this kind of system, the reduction wave occurs at much more negative potentials than $E^{0^{\prime}}$, and the oxidation wave lies at much more positive values.

The exchange current can be viewed as a kind of "idle rate" for charge exchange across the interface. If one wants to draw a net current that is only a small fraction of this bidirectional idle current, only a tiny overpotential will be required to extract it. Even at equilibrium, the system is delivering charge across the interface at rates much greater than we require on a net basis. The role of the slight overpotential is to slightly unbalance the rates in the two directions so that one of them predominates. However, if we ask for a net current that exceeds the exchange current, the job is much harder. We must drive the system to deliver charge at the required rate, and we can do that only by applying a significant overpotential. From this perspective, we see that the exchange current is a measure of any system's ability to deliver a net current without a significant energy loss due to activation.

Exchange current densities in real systems reflect the wide range in $k^{0}$, amplified by the wide range in possible concentrations. Values may exceed $10 \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ or be less than $1 \mathrm{pA} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$.

### (b) Linear Characteristic at Small $\boldsymbol{\eta}$

For small values of $x$, an exponential $e^{x}$ can be approximated as $1+x$; hence, for sufficiently small $\eta$, (3.4.11) can be re-expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=-i_{0} f \eta \tag{3.4.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, the net current is linearly related to overpotential in a narrow potential range near $E_{\text {eq }}$. The ratio $-\eta / i$ has units of resistance and is often called the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\mathrm{ct}}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{ct}}=\frac{R T}{F i_{0}} \tag{3.4.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

This parameter is the negative reciprocal slope of the $i-\eta$ curve at the origin ( $\eta=0, i=0$ ). It can be evaluated directly in some experiments, and it serves as a convenient index of kinetic facility. For very large $k^{0}$, it approaches zero (Figure 3.4.2a).

### (c) Tafel Behavior at Large $\boldsymbol{\eta}$

For large values of $\eta$ (either negative or positive), one of the bracketed terms in (3.4.11) becomes negligible. For example, at large negative overpotentials, $\exp (-\alpha f \eta) \gg \exp [(1-\alpha) f \eta]$ and (3.4.11)
becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0} e^{-\alpha f \eta} \tag{3.4.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=\frac{R T}{\alpha F} \ln i_{0}-\frac{R T}{\alpha F} \ln i \tag{3.4.15}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we find that the kinetic treatment outlined above does yield a relation of the Tafel form, as required by common observation for the appropriate conditions. The empirical Tafel constants (see equation 3.2.4) can now be identified from theory as ${ }^{13}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& a=\frac{2.303 R T}{\alpha F} \log i_{0}  \tag{3.4.16a}\\
& b=\frac{-2.303 R T}{\alpha F} \tag{3.4.16b}
\end{align*}
$$

The Tafel form can be expected to hold whenever the back reaction (i.e., the anodic process, when a net reduction is considered) contributes less than $1 \%$ of the current, or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}}{e^{-\alpha f \eta}}=e^{f \eta} \leq 0.01 \quad(\eta<0) \tag{3.4.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

which implies that $|\eta|>118 \mathrm{mV}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} .^{14}$ When electrode kinetics are sluggish and significant activation overpotentials are required, good Tafel relationships can be seen. This point underscores the fact that Tafel behavior is an indicator of totally irreversible kinetics. Such systems allow no significant current flow except at high overpotentials, where the faradaic process is effectively unidirectional. If the electrode kinetics are facile, the system will approach the mass-transfer-limited current by the time such an overpotential is established. Tafel relationships cannot be observed for such cases, because (3.4.14) rests upon the absence of mass-transfer effects on the current.

### (d) Tafel Plots

A plot of $\eta$ vs. $\log i$ or (more commonly) $\log i$ vs. $\eta$-either known as a Tafel plot-is a classical tool for evaluating kinetic parameters (7). In the form of $\log i$ vs. $\eta$, there is an anodic branch with slope $(1-\alpha) F / 2.303 R T$ and a cathodic branch with slope $-\alpha F / 2.303 R T$. As shown in Figure 3.4.4, both linear segments extrapolate to an intercept of $\log i_{0}$. The plots deviate sharply from linear behavior as $\eta$ approaches zero, because the back reaction begins to contribute appreciably to the net current. The transfer coefficient and the exchange current are readily accessible from this kind of presentation when it indeed applies to an elementary reaction. For complex electrode reactions, Tafel plots remain useful for mechanistic diagnosis, but quantitative interpretation becomes more complicated by the need to include intermediates in the treatment (Section 15.2.2).

Some real Tafel plots are shown in Figure 3.4.5 for the $\mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{IV}) / \mathrm{Mn}(\mathrm{III})$ system in concentrated acid (37). The negative deviations from linearity at very large overpotentials arise from limitations imposed by mass transfer. The region of very low overpotentials shows sharp falloffs for the reason outlined just above.

A modified approach allows the use of data obtained at low overpotentials (38). Equation 3.4.11 can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0} e^{-\alpha f \eta}\left(1-e^{f \eta}\right) \tag{3.4.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log \frac{i}{1-e^{f \eta}}=\log i_{0}-\frac{\alpha F \eta}{2.303 R T} \tag{3.4.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

so that a plot of $\log \left[i / 1-e^{f \eta}\right]$ vs. $\eta$ yields an intercept of $\log i_{0}$ and a slope of $-\alpha F / 2.303 R T$. This method is applicable to electrode reactions that are not totally irreversible, i.e., those in which both the anodic and cathodic processes contribute significantly to the currents measured in the overpotential range where mass-transfer effects are not important. Such systems are often termed quasireversible, because the opposing charge-transfer reactions must both be considered; yet, a noticeable activation overpotential is required to drive a net current through the interface.

## 3.4.4 Exchange Current Plots

From equation 3.4.4, we recognize that the exchange current can be restated as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log i_{0}=\log F A k^{0}+\log C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}+\frac{\alpha F}{2.303 R T} E^{0^{\prime}}-\frac{\alpha F}{2.303 R T} E_{\mathrm{eq}} \tag{3.4.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, a plot of $\log i_{0} v s . E_{\mathrm{eq}}$ at constant $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ should be linear with a slope of $-\alpha F / 2.303 R T$. The equilibrium potential, $E_{\text {eq }}$, can be varied experimentally by changing the bulk concentration of species R , while that of species O is held constant. This kind of plot is useful for obtaining $\alpha$ from experiments in which $i_{0}$ is measured essentially directly (Sections 9.6 and 11.4).

Another means for determining $\alpha$ is suggested by rewriting (3.4.6) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log i_{0}=\log F A k^{0}+(1-\alpha) \log C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}+\alpha \log C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*} \tag{3.4.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left(\frac{\partial \log i_{0}}{\partial \log C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}\right)_{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}=1-\alpha  \tag{3.4.22a}\\
& \left(\frac{\partial \log i_{0}}{\partial \log C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}\right)_{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}=\alpha \tag{3.4.22b}
\end{align*}
$$

An alternative equation, which does not require holding either $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ or $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ constant, is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d \log \left(i_{0} / C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}\right)}{d \log \left(C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*} / C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}\right)}=\alpha \tag{3.4.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is easily derived from (3.4.6).

## 3.4.5 Very Facile Kinetics and Reversible Behavior

For any kinetic model, an important limiting case is where the electrode kinetics require a negligible driving force. As we noted above, this situation corresponds to a very large exchange current, which in turn reflects a big standard rate constant, $k^{0}$. Let us rewrite the current-overpotential equation, (3.4.10), as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}} e^{-\alpha f \eta}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta} \tag{3.4.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

and consider its behavior when $i_{0}$ becomes very large compared to any current of interest. Because $i / i_{0} \rightarrow 0$, we can rearrange (3.4.24) to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{f\left(E-E_{\mathrm{eq}}\right)} \tag{3.4.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

and, by substitution from the Nernst equation in form (3.4.2), we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}=e^{f\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} e^{f\left(E-E_{\mathrm{eq}}\right)} \tag{3.4.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}=e^{f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.4.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation can be rearranged to a very important result:

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)} \tag{3.4.28}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we see that the electrode potential and the surface concentrations of O and R are linked by an equation of the Nernst form, regardless of current flow.

No kinetic parameters are present in (3.4.28) because the kinetics are so facile that no experimental manifestations can be seen. In effect, the potential and the surface concentrations are always kept in equilibrium by the fast charge-transfer processes, and the thermodynamic equation, (3.4.28), characteristic of equilibrium, always holds. Net current flows only because the surface concentrations are not at equilibrium with the bulk. Mass transfer continuously moves the electroreactant to the surface, where it must be reconciled to the potential by electrochemical change.

We have already seen that a system that is always at equilibrium is termed a reversible system (Section 2.1.1); thus, it is logical that an electrochemical system in which the charge-transfer interface is always at equilibrium be called reversible (or, alternatively, nernstian). These terms are simply labels for cases in which the interfacial redox kinetics are so fast that activation effects cannot be seen. Many such systems exist in electrochemistry, so we will consider this case frequently under different experimental circumstances. We will also see that any given system may appear reversible, quasireversible, or totally irreversible, depending on the demands we make on the charge-transfer kinetics.

## 3.4.6 Effects of Mass Transfer

A more complete $i-\eta$ relation can be obtained from (3.4.10) by substituting for $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) / C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ according to (1.3.11) and (1.3.20):

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\left(1-\frac{i}{i_{l, c}}\right) e^{-\alpha f \eta}-\left(1-\frac{i}{i_{l, a}}\right) e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta} \tag{3.4.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Problem 3.2, the reader has the opportunity to show that (3.4.29) can be rearranged to give $i$ explicitly vs. $\eta$ over the whole range of $\eta$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=\frac{e^{-\alpha f \eta}-e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}}{\frac{1}{i_{0}}+\frac{e^{-\alpha f \eta}}{i_{l, \mathrm{c}}}-\frac{e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}}{i_{l, \mathrm{a}}}} \tag{3.4.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Figure 3.4.6, one can see $i-\eta$ curves drawn from (3.4.30) for several ratios of $i_{0} / i_{l}$, where $i_{l}=i_{l, \mathrm{c}}=-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}$. As we have now learned to expect, the anodic and cathodic branches separate on the potential axis when the demanded net current exceeds the exchange current. For Figure 3.4.6, the scale of net current is defined by $i_{l}$ (the largest possible net current, given the mass-transfer conditions). When $i_{0} / i_{l}$ is large, the system is reversible, and when $i_{0} / i_{l}$ is very small, total irreversibility applies. For $i_{0} / i_{l}$ on the order of unity, the system is quasireversible.

For small overpotentials, the behavior can be linearized. The complete Taylor expansion (Section A.2) of (3.4.24) gives, for $\alpha f \eta \ll 1$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}-\frac{F \eta}{R T} \tag{3.4.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

which can be substituted from (1.3.11) and (1.3.20) and rearranged to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=-i \frac{R T}{F}\left(\frac{1}{i_{0}}+\frac{1}{i_{l, \mathrm{c}}}-\frac{1}{i_{l, \mathrm{a}}}\right) \tag{3.4.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

In terms of the charge- and mass-transfer pseudoresistances defined in (1.3.29) and (3.4.13), this equation is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=-i\left(R_{\mathrm{ct}}+R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{c}}+R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{a}}\right) \tag{3.4.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-21.jpg?height=684&width=1030&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=199)
Figure 3.4.6 Relationship between the activation overpotential and net current demand relative to the exchange current. The reaction is $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ with $\alpha=0.5, T=298 \mathrm{~K}$, and $i_{l, \mathrm{c}}=-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}=i_{l}$. Numbers by curves show $i_{0} / i_{l}$.

Now we see very clearly that when $i_{0}$ is much greater than the limiting currents, $R_{\mathrm{ct}} \ll R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{c}}+R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{a}}$, so that the overpotential, even near $E_{\mathrm{eq}}$, is a concentration overpotential. On the other hand, if $i_{0}$ is much less than the limiting currents, then $R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{c}}+R_{\mathrm{mt}, \mathrm{a}} \ll R_{\mathrm{ct}}$, and the overpotential near $E_{\mathrm{eq}}$ is due to activation of charge transfer.

In the Tafel regions, other useful forms of (3.4.29) can be obtained. For the cathodic branch at large $\eta$, the anodic contribution is insignificant, and (3.4.29) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\left(1-\frac{i}{i_{1, \mathrm{c}}}\right) e^{-\alpha f \eta} \tag{3.4.34}

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=\frac{R T}{\alpha F} \ln \frac{i_{0}}{i_{1, \mathrm{c}}}+\frac{R T}{\alpha F} \ln \frac{\left(i_{1, \mathrm{c}}-i\right)}{i} \tag{3.4.35}

$$

This equation can be useful for obtaining kinetic parameters for systems in which the normal Tafel plots are complicated by mass-transfer effects. Not given here, but easily developed, are the analogous results for the anodic branch.

## 3.4.7 Limits of Basic Butler-Volmer Equations

If only O and R participate in a $1 e$ elementary process, the results we have developed here are generally applicable, even if O or R (or both) is other than a solute, perhaps being bound to the electrode surface or incorporated into a three-dimensional lattice. However, one must take care with the expression of concentrations.

In the $i-E$ characteristic, (3.3.8), the units chosen for $k^{0}$ determine the representation of the two surface concentrations, and both must be in the same units. If, as in our treatment above, $k^{0}$ is in $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$, then both $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)$, are three-dimensional concentrations in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Alternatively, $k^{0}$ can be in $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ when two-dimensional concentrations [e.g., $\Gamma_{\mathrm{O}}(t)$ and $\Gamma_{\mathrm{R}}(t)$ in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ] are more appropriate, as in a case where O and R are bound to the surface (Section 17.6.2). The requirement that the same units apply to both surface concentrations
complicates the kinetic relationships for some elementary electrode reactions, such as the electrodeposition of a metal or a reaction where O is a solute, but R is adsorbed. A formulation of BV kinetics in terms of activities can be more functional in such situations.

Another notable point is that elementary electrode reactions often involve participants other than O and R , such as ligands, protons, leaving groups, and adsorption sites. The BV results derived to this point do not accommodate elementary reactions involving such species. Only O and R participate in the underlying model, so it is not appropriate to apply the results to cases that involve participants other than O and R . One can adapt the BV model to address them, but we defer examples to Chapter 15.
