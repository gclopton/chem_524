# 3.6 Open-Circuit Potential and Multiple Half-Reactions at an Electrode

The open-circuit potential (OCP) of an electrode is defined as the potential where the net current is zero. Normally, it is measured between a working and reference electrode using a high-input-impedance device without any other connections to the working electrode.

[^21]The OCP is the potential where the anodic and cathodic half-reaction currents offset each other precisely. When both halves of a single redox couple are present and other electroactive species do not contribute significantly to current flow, the system behaves as shown in Figure 3.4.1, and the OCP is the equilibrium potential defined by the Nernst equation for that couple. The OCP is said to be well poised under these conditions, (i.e., it does not drift with time or with slight changes in solution conditions).

However, not all experimental systems are so simple. There is a need for a more general description of the OCP that can explain the potential measured when an inert working electrode is immersed in electrolyte in the absence of obvious faradaic processes, or when the solution concentrations for the redox species making up a couple are so small that the OCP is no longer close to the Nernst potential (108).

## 3.6.1 Open-Circuit Potential in Multicomponent Systems

In general, electrochemical systems involve several (often many) electroactive species. Beyond deliberately added solutes, which usually are of primary interest, electroactivity may also arise from the solvent, the supporting electrolyte, the material of the working electrode, or contaminants, such as oxygen or impurities introduced with the solvent or the supporting electrolyte. At any given potential and at any given time, the working electrode passes a total current that is the sum of all individual currents arising from the anodic and cathodic half-reactions taking place there. Thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i(E, t)=\sum_{j} i_{\mathrm{c}, j}(E, t)-\sum_{j} i_{\mathrm{a}, j}(E, t) \tag{3.6.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the sums run over all relevant electrode reactions, and $i_{\mathrm{c}, j}$ and $i_{\mathrm{a}, j}$ are the cathodic and anodic component currents for each such process. At the OCP, $i=0$, therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{j} i_{\mathrm{c}, j}(E, t)=\sum_{j} i_{\mathrm{a}, j}(E, t) \tag{3.6.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

If the individual component currents vary with time, the zero-current point can drift.
When the cathodic and anodic component currents are not dominated by a single couple, but arise from electrode reactions based on different couples, the OCP is not an equilibrium potential, but is instead called a mixed potential. The net cathodic current at the OCP (equal in magnitude to the net anodic current) is sometimes called the mixed current, $i_{\text {mix }}$. In principle, the partial currents might be calculated from theory, such as Butler-Volmer kinetics; however, the contributing species for the relevant reactions may not be known. Consider, for example, a Pt electrode immersed in deaerated 0.1 M KCl . Possible cathodic half-reactions include the reduction of protons, water, or trace oxygen, while anodic reactions might involve the oxidation of water or impurities.

Curves are shown schematically in Figure 3.6.1a for a situation in which the predominant half-reactions are well separated on the potential scale-meaning that there is a gap between the regions where the anodic current for the oxidizable species and the cathodic current for the reducible species reach toward their mass-transfer limits. This case applies when the standard potential for the oxidizable species, $E_{\mathrm{Ox}}^{0}$, is on the positive side of the standard potential for the reducible species, $E_{\text {Red }}^{0}$. While the net process leading to the mixed current is not thermodynamically spontaneous, it can happen modestly because the feet of the curves describing $i_{\mathrm{a}}$ for Ox and $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ for Red do overlap. The mixed current at the OCP is small-orders of magnitude less than the mass-transfer limit for either $i_{\mathrm{a}}$ or $i_{\mathrm{c}}$.

In the opposite situation, where $E_{\mathrm{Ox}}^{0}<E_{\text {Red }}^{0}$, as in Figure 3.6.1b, the net faradaic reaction describing the mixed process becomes spontaneous, and the mixed current can be much larger. In effect, the mixed process manifests a galvanic cell.

Figure 3.6.1 Cathodic and anodic half-reactions contributing to the OCP. In both ( $a$ ) and ( $b$ ), the anodic component current, $i_{\mathrm{a}}$ (dashed curve), arises from a couple with standard potential $E_{\mathrm{Ox}^{\prime}}^{0}$, while the cathodic component current, $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ (solid curve) arises from a different couple with standard potential $E_{\text {Red }}^{0}$. (a) A system in which $E_{\mathrm{Ox}}^{0}>E_{\text {Red }}^{0}$ (e.g., reduction of protons or water and oxidation of a trace impurity at a Pt surface). At the OCP, $i_{\mathrm{c}}=\left|i_{\mathrm{a}}\right|=i_{\text {mix }}$, which must be small. (b) A system in which $E_{\mathrm{Ox}}^{0}<E_{\text {Red }}^{0}$ (e.g., oxygen reduction and Fe oxidation at an iron surface). Here, $i_{\mathrm{a}}$ for Ox and $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ for Red overlap in the zone where both are strongly rising. At the OCP, $i_{\mathrm{c}}=\left|i_{\mathrm{a}}\right|=i_{\text {mix }}$, which can even be at the mass-transfer limit for Ox or Red. In this case, $i_{\text {mix }}$ is about $65 \%$ of the limiting value for $i_{c}$.

## 3.6.2 Establishment or Loss of Nernstian Behavior at an Electrode

Now suppose both forms of a redox couple, e.g., $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$, are added to the $\mathrm{Pt} / 0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KCl}$ system depicted schematically by Figure 3.6.1a. The half-reaction currents for the ferri- and ferrocyanide would add to all other currents in (3.6.1) and (3.6.2), but if their contributions remained negligible, the OCP would not change much. However, as the added concentration of the $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ increases over orders of magnitude, the half-reaction currents from this couple eventually overwhelm the currents from background processes, and the OCP shifts toward the nernstian value for the redox couple.

Figure 3.6.2 shows experimental results demonstrating this behavior. When the total concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ is in the $\mu \mathrm{M}$ to nM range, the OCP remains near that of deaerated 0.1 M

KCl ; however, it attains the Nernst potential of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ just below the mM range. In this example, equimolar amounts of ferri- and ferrocyanide were always added, so $E_{\text {eq }}=E^{0^{\prime}}$ in the poised state.

Of course, a poised electrode can become unpoised by reversal of the process just described. If, for example, an $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ solution in the mM range is progressively diluted by orders of magnitude, the contributions of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ to the mix of currents at the electrode will become progressively less significant, and the potential will fall down the curve in Figure 3.6.2. It is the competition from background currents that eventually prevents $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-/ 4-}$ from maintaining its nernstian balance at the electrode.

## 3.6.3 Multiple Half-Reaction Currents in $i-E$ Curves

When faradaic currents flow, contributions are normally made to the total current from more than one process. Almost always, there is some background current from the sources described above for the "pure" supporting electrolyte solution. This can usually be accounted for by observing the behavior in the absence of the redox species under study.

More extreme examples of mixed currents are found for processes that occur close to, or even beyond, the solvent/supporting electrolyte background limits, caused, for example, by water oxidation and proton reduction. A classic example is the Kolbe electrolysis, which occurs with considerable oxygen evolution at the electrode. This process involves the oxidation of a carboxylate to form hydrocarbons, e.g.,

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}-e \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \bullet  \tag{3.6.3}\\
& 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \bullet \rightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \tag{3.6.4}
\end{align*}
$$

Another multicurrent situation is found in the hydrogen evolution reaction, when a metal electrode, e.g., Mn , can simultaneously oxidize during the reductive production of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. Determining the different contributions of processes to the net current in such a case generally requires the use of a second electrode, as in SECM (Chapter 18), to monitor the production of one of the products.
