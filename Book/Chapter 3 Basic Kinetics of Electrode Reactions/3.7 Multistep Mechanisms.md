# 3.7 Multistep Mechanisms

In Sections 3.3-3.5, we achieved a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the major features of electrode kinetics, and we developed a set of relations that we can expect to fit many real chemical systems, such as

$$
\begin{align*}
& \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{3-}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{4-}  \tag{3.7.1}\\
& \mathrm{Tl}^{+}+e \stackrel{\mathrm{Hg}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{Tl}(\mathrm{Hg})  \tag{3.7.2}\\
& \text { Anthracene }+e \rightleftharpoons \text { Anthracene }- \tag{3.7.3}
\end{align*}
$$

However, we must now recognize that most electrode processes are mechanisms of steps. For example, the important reaction

$$
\begin{equation*}
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \tag{3.7.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

clearly must involve several elementary reactions. The hydrogen nuclei are separated in the oxidized form, but are combined by reduction. Somehow during reduction, there must be a pair of charge transfers and some chemical process linking the two nuclei.

Consider also the reduction

$$
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{Sn}(\mathrm{IV})+2 e \rightleftharpoons \operatorname{Sn}(\mathrm{II}) \tag{3.7.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

Is it realistic to regard two electrons as tunneling simultaneously through the interface? Or must we consider reduction and oxidation as sequential $1 e$ processes proceeding through the ephemeral intermediate Sn (III)? ${ }^{35}$

Much effort has been spent on the mechanisms of complex electrode reactions, and there is a large literature on the subject ( $7-13,110$ ), because many such reactions are of great fundamental and technological importance. With this edition, the authors seek to provide a more detailed treatment of complex electrode processes. Toward that end, it is convenient to distinguish three categories: ${ }^{36}$

1) Outer-sphere heterogeneous electron transfer coupled to homogeneous reactions. The product of a heterogeneous electron transfer often engages in subsequent solution phase reactions (e.g., protonation, decomposition, change in ligation, or radical coupling). There are also cases in which the electroreactant is involved in a homogeneous equilibrium or is itself the product of a preceding homogeneous reaction. For electrode reactions in this category, one can view the electrode as an initiator or interrogator of the homogeneous chemistry. Mechanisms are varied and can be simple or complex. Chapter 13 is devoted largely to processes in this category.
2) Multiple outer-sphere heterogeneous electron transfers. Many species, including Sn(IV) and Sn (II), mentioned above, undergo multielectron reduction or oxidation at an electrode. Even if all reactants, products, and intermediates are chemically stable, these processes can become complex. Chapter 13 addresses them.
3) Inner-sphere electrode reactions. In this category, there is chemical binding of at least one participant to the electrode surface, and the overall reaction kinetics are sensitive to the chemical identity of the electrode. Adsorbed intermediates are frequently involved, as in the important example of $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$, identified above. The electroplating of metals falls in this category, too. Chapter 15, new in this edition, is dedicated to inner-sphere electrode reactions.

The chemical variety of electrode processes is too great to capture under just three headings, but these categories encompass a large range of behavior. Discussion of specific cases is reserved for Chapters 13 and 15. In the remainder of this section, we address only a few broadly applicable points concerning multistep processes.

## 3.7.1 The Primacy of One-Electron Transfers

A widely held concept in electrochemistry is that truly elementary electron-transfer reactions always involve the exchange of one electron, so that an overall process involving a change of $n$ electrons must involve $n$ distinct electron-transfer steps. ${ }^{37}$ Equations similar to those derived

[^22]above for the one-step, one-electron process can be used to describe each of these elementary steps, although the concentrations must often be understood as applying to intermediates, rather than to starting species or final products. Of course, the overall process may also involve other elementary reactions, such as adsorption, desorption, or various chemical reactions away from the interface.

## 3.7.2 Rate-Determining, Outer-Sphere Electron Transfer

In the study of chemical kinetics, one often simplifies the prediction and analysis of behavior by recognizing that a single step, much more sluggish than all others, controls the rate of the overall reaction. If the mechanism is an electrode process, this rate-determining step (RDS) can be a heterogeneous electron-transfer reaction.

Consider an overall process in which O and R are coupled in an overall multielectron process

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R} \tag{3.7.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

by a mechanism having the following general character:

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
\mathrm{O}+n^{\prime} e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{O}^{\prime} & \text { (net result of steps preceding } \mathrm{RDS}, E_{\text {pre }}^{0^{\prime}} \text { ) } \\
\mathrm{O}^{\prime}+e \stackrel{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{\underset{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} & \text { (outer }- \text { sphere } \mathrm{RDS}, E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}} \text { ) } \\
\mathrm{R}^{\prime}+n^{\prime \prime} e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R} & \text { (net result of steps following } \mathrm{RDS}, E_{\text {post }}^{0^{\prime}} \text { ) } \tag{3.7.9}
\end{array}
$$

where $n^{\prime}+n^{\prime \prime}+1=n .^{38}$
The $i-E$ characteristic can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=n F A k_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}^{\prime}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}} f\left(E-E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}}\right)}-C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}(0, t) e^{\left(1-\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) f\left(E-E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}}\right)}\right] \tag{3.7.10}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $k_{\text {rds }}^{0}, \alpha_{\text {rds }}$, and $E_{\text {rds }}^{0^{\prime}}$ apply to the RDS. This relation is (3.3.8) written for the RDS and multiplied by $n$, because each net conversion of $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ to $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ results in the flow of $n$ electrons, not just one electron, across the interface. The concentrations $C_{\mathrm{O}^{\prime}}(0, t)$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}(0, t)$ are controlled not only by the interplay between mass transfer and the kinetics of heterogeneous electron transfer, as we found in Section 3.4, but also by the properties of the preceding and following reactions. The situation can become quite complicated, so we will make no attempt to discuss the general problem. However, a few important simple cases exist, and we will develop them briefly now. ${ }^{39}$

## 3.7.3 Multistep Processes at Equilibrium

Even though a process may involve a complex mechanism, it still must obey the Nernst equation whenever true equilibrium can be established $\left[i=0\right.$ and $C_{j}(0, t)=C_{j}^{*}$ for all $\left.j\right]$. The electrode

[^23]potential is then determined by the concentrations of the initial reactant and final product. For solutes O and R linked by $n$ electrons,
$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{eq}}=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} \tag{3.7.11}
\end{equation*}
$$
where $E^{0^{\prime}}$ is the formal potential of the overall reaction. This is a consequence of the thermodynamics of the system and microscopic reversibility. ${ }^{40}$ Mechanistic details are irrelevant at equilibrium.

## 3.7.4 Nernstian Multistep Processes

If all steps in a complex electrode process are facile, so that the exchange velocities of all steps are large compared to the net reaction rate, the concentrations of all species participating in them are always essentially at local equilibrium, even though a net current flows. Since it is only at the electrode surface that the forward and backward processes can happen for a heterogeneous electrode process, it is only at the surface that the thermodynamic balance can be continuously maintained. For chemically reversible systems with facile kinetics, the surface concentrations of reactants and products (even those of initial reactants and final products in a multistep process) are always tied to the electrode potential by an equation of the Nernst form. For solutes O and R linked by $n$ electrons: ${ }^{41}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)} \tag{3.7.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

A great many real systems satisfy these conditions, and electrochemical examination of them can yield a rich variety of chemical information (Section 5.3.2). An example is the reduction of the ethylenediamine (en) complex of Cd(II) at a mercury electrode:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{en})_{3}^{2+}+2 e \stackrel{\mathrm{Hg}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{Hg})+3 \mathrm{en} \tag{3.7.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

## 3.7.5 Quasireversible and Irreversible Multistep Processes

If a multistep process is neither nernstian nor at equilibrium, the details of the kinetics influence its behavior in electrochemical experiments, and one can use the results to diagnose the mechanism and to quantify kinetic parameters. As in the study of homogeneous kinetics, one proceeds by devising a hypothetical mechanism, predicting experimental behavior according to the hypothesis, and comparing the predictions against results. In the electrochemical sphere, an important part of predicting behavior is developing the $i-E$ characteristic in terms of controllable parameters, such as the concentrations of participating species.

If the RDS is a heterogeneous electron-transfer step, then the current-potential characteristic has the form of (3.7.10). For most mechanisms, this equation is of limited direct utility, because $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ are intermediates, whose concentration cannot be controlled directly. Still, (3.7.10) can serve as the basis for a more practical current-potential relationship, because one can sometimes use the presumed mechanism to re-express $C_{\mathrm{O}^{\prime}}(0, t)$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}(0, t)$ in terms of the concentrations of more controllable species, such as O and R (111).

[^24]The general case can easily become too complex for practical application. Even for the simple mechanism in (3.7.7)-(3.7.9), where the pre- and post-reactions are assumed to be kinetically facile enough to remain in local equilibrium, one must have ways to find out the individual values of $n^{\prime}, n^{\prime \prime}, E_{\text {pre }}^{0^{\prime}}, E_{\text {post }}^{0^{\prime}}$, and $E_{\text {rds }}^{0^{\prime}}$ before one can evaluate the kinetics of the RDS in a fully quantitative way. ${ }^{42}$ This is normally a difficult requirement.

More readily usable results arise from some simpler situations.

### (a) Totally Irreversible Initial Step

Suppose the RDS is the first step in the mechanism and is also a totally irreversible outer-sphere heterogeneous electron transfer:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{O}+e \xrightarrow{k_{\mathrm{f}}} \mathrm{R}^{\prime} & \text { (outer-sphere RDS, } \left.E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}}\right) \\
\mathrm{R}^{\prime}+n^{\prime \prime} e \rightarrow \mathrm{R} & \text { (net result of steps following RDS) } \tag{3.7.15}
\end{array}
$$

The chemistry following (3.7.14) has no effect on the electrochemical response, except to add $n^{\prime \prime}$ electrons per molecule of O that reacts. Thus, the current is $n=1+n^{\prime \prime}$ times bigger than the current arising from step (3.7.14) alone. The overall result is given by the first term of (3.7.10) with $C_{\mathrm{O}^{\prime}}(0, t)=C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=n F A k_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}} f\left(E-E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.7.16}
\end{equation*}
$$

Examples exist, such as the polarographic reduction of chromate in 0.1 M NaOH :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{CrO}_{4}^{2-}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+3 e \rightarrow \mathrm{Cr}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}^{-}+4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \tag{3.7.17}
\end{equation*}
$$

Despite the obvious mechanistic complexity of this system, it behaves as though it has an irreversible electron transfer as the first step.

### (b) Chemically Reversible Processes Near Equilibrium

Some experimental methods, such as impedance spectroscopy (Chapter 11), are based on the application of small perturbations to a system otherwise at equilibrium. These methods often provide the exchange current in a relatively direct manner. It is worthwhile for us to consider the exchange properties of a multistep process at equilibrium. The example that we will take is the overall process $\mathrm{O}+n e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$, effected by the general mechanism in (3.7.7)-(3.7.9) and having a formal potential $E^{0^{\prime}}$.

At equilibrium, all steps in the mechanism are individually at equilibrium, and each has an exchange velocity. The electron-transfer reactions have exchange velocities that can be expressed as exchange currents. There is also an exchange velocity for the overall process that can be expressed as an exchange current. In a serial mechanism with a single RDS, such as we are now considering, the overall exchange velocity is limited by the exchange velocity through the RDS.

One can readily show that ${ }^{43}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
i_{0}=n F A k_{\mathrm{app}}^{0} C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*\left[1-\left(n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) / n\right]} C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}{ }^{\left[\left(n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) / n\right]} \tag{3.7.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the apparent standard rate constant, $k_{\mathrm{app}}^{0}$ is

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{app}}^{0}=k_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0} e^{n^{\prime} f\left(E_{\mathrm{pre}}^{0^{\prime}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} e^{\alpha f\left(E_{\mathrm{rds}}^{0^{\prime}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.7.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^25]This relationship applies generally to mechanisms fitting the pattern of (3.7.7)-(3.7.9), but not to others, such as those involving purely homogeneous pre- or post-reactions, or those involving different RDSs in the forward and reverse directions. Even so, the principles used to obtain (3.7.18) can be employed to derive an analogous expression for any other pattern, provided that the steps are chemically reversible and equilibrium applies. It will be generally possible to express the overall exchange current in terms of an apparent standard rate constant and the bulk concentrations of the various participants. If the exchange current can be measured validly for a given process, the derived relationship can provide insight into details of the mechanism.

For example, by an approach similar to that in Section 3.4.4, one obtains the following from (3.7.18):

$$
\begin{align*}
& \left(\frac{\partial \log i_{0}}{\partial \log C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}\right)_{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}=1-\frac{n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}}{n}  \tag{3.7.20}\\
& \left(\frac{\partial \log i_{0}}{\partial \log C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}}\right)_{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}=\frac{n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}}{n} \tag{3.7.21}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $n$ is often independently available from coulometry or from chemical knowledge of the reactants and products, one can frequently calculate $n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\text {rds }}$. From its magnitude, one may be able to estimate separate values for $n^{\prime}$ and $\alpha_{\text {rds }}$, which can afford chemical insight into the participants in the RDS.

As one can see above, $k_{\mathrm{app}}^{0}$ is usually not a simple kinetic parameter for a multistep process. Interpreting it may require detailed understanding of the mechanism, including knowledge of standard potentials or equilibrium constants for various elementary steps.

For a quasireversible mechanism having the pattern of (3.7.7)-(3.7.9), one can also show that the current-overpotential equation is ${ }^{44}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{i}{i_{0}}=\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}} e^{-\left(n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) f \eta}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{\left(n^{\prime \prime}+1-\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) f \eta} \tag{3.7.22}
\end{equation*}
$$

When the current is small or mass transfer is efficient, the surface concentrations do not differ from those of the bulk, and one has

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0}\left[e^{-\left(n^{\prime}+\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) f \eta}-e^{\left(n^{\prime \prime}+1-\alpha_{\mathrm{rds}}\right) f \eta}\right] \tag{3.7.23}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is analogous to (3.4.11). At small overpotentials, this relationship can be linearized to give

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=-i_{0} n f \eta \tag{3.7.24}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the counterpart of (3.4.12). The charge-transfer resistance for this multistep system is then

$$
\begin{equation*}
R_{\mathrm{ct}}=\frac{R T}{n F i_{0}} \tag{3.7.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is a generalization of (3.4.13).
The arguments leading to (3.7.22)-(3.7.25) are particular to the assumed mechanistic pattern of (3.7.7)-(3.7.9), but similar results can be obtained by the same techniques for any quasireversible mechanism. In fact, (3.7.24) and (3.7.25) are general for quasireversible multistep processes, and they underlie the experimental determination of $i_{0}$ via methods, such as impedance spectroscopy, based on small perturbations of systems at equilibrium.
