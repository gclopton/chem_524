# 3.1 Review of Homogeneous Kinetics

## 3.1.1 Dynamic Equilibrium

Consider two substances, A and B, that are linked by simple unimolecular elementary reactions. ${ }^{1}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{A} \underset{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{\stackrel{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{~B} \tag{3.1.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

Both elementary reactions are always active, and the rates of the forward and backward processes, $v_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{b}}\left(\mathrm{molL}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$, are

$$
\begin{align*}
& v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{A}}  \tag{3.1.2a}\\
& v_{\mathrm{b}}=k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{B}} \tag{3.1.2b}
\end{align*}
$$

The rate constants, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$, have units of $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and one can easily show that they are the reciprocals of the mean lifetimes of A and B , respectively (Problem 3.6). The net conversion rate of A to B is

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{net}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{A}}-k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{B}} \tag{3.1.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

At equilibrium, the net conversion rate is zero; hence,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{k_{\mathrm{b}}}=K=\frac{C_{\mathrm{B}}}{C_{\mathrm{A}}} \tag{3.1.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

The kinetic theory, therefore, predicts a fixed concentration ratio at equilibrium, just as thermodynamic theory does.

[^0]Such agreement is required of any kinetic theory. In the limit of equilibrium, the kinetic equations must collapse to relations of the thermodynamic form. Kinetics describe the evolution of the system, including both the approach to equilibrium and the dynamic maintenance of that state. Thermodynamics describe only equilibrium. Understanding of a system is not even at a crude level unless the kinetic and thermodynamic views agree on the properties of the equilibrium state.

On the other hand, thermodynamics provide no information about the mechanism required to maintain equilibrium, whereas kinetics describe the balance quantitatively. In the example above, equilibrium features nonzero rates of conversion of A to B (and vice versa), but those rates are equal. Sometimes they are called the exchange velocity of the reaction, $v_{0}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{0}=k_{\mathrm{f}}\left(C_{\mathrm{A}}\right)_{\mathrm{eq}}=k_{\mathrm{b}}\left(C_{\mathrm{B}}\right)_{\mathrm{eq}} \tag{3.1.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

The idea of exchange velocity is important in treatments of electrode kinetics.

## 3.1.2 The Arrhenius Equation and Potential Energy Surfaces

It is an experimental fact that most rate constants vary with temperature in a common fashion: $\ln k$ is nearly always linear with $1 / T$. Arrhenius was first to recognize the generality of this behavior, and he proposed that rate constants be expressed in the form:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k=A e^{-E_{\mathrm{A}} / R T} \tag{3.1.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $E_{\mathrm{A}}$ has units of energy. Since the exponential factor is reminiscent of the probability of using thermal energy to surmount an energy barrier of height $E_{\mathrm{A}}$, that parameter has been known as the activation energy. If the exponential expresses the probability of surmounting the barrier, then $A$ must be related to the frequency of attempts on it; thus, $A$ is known commonly as the frequency factor. As usual, these ideas turn out to be oversimplifications, but they carry an essence of truth and are useful for casting a mental image of the ways in which reactions proceed.

The idea of activation energy has led to pictures of reaction paths in terms of potential energy along a reaction coordinate (1-5). An example is shown in Figure 3.1.1. In a simple unimolecular process, e.g., the cis-trans isomerization of stilbene, the reaction coordinate might be an easily recognized molecular parameter, such as the twist angle about the central double bond in stilbene. More generally, the reaction coordinate expresses progress along a favored path on a multidimensional surface describing potential energy as a function of all relevant atomic coordinates for a single set of reactants and products (e.g., one molecule of stilbene). One zone of this surface corresponds to the configuration we call "reactant," and another corresponds to the "product." Both must be found at minima on the energy surface, because they are the only configurations possessing a significant lifetime. Even though other configurations are possible, they must lie at higher energies and lack the energy minimum required for even momentary stability. As the reaction takes place, the coordinates change from those of the reactant to those of the product. Since the path along the reaction coordinate connects two minima, it must rise, pass over a maximum, then fall into the product zone. Very often, the height of the maximum above a valley or "hollow" is identified with an activation energy, either $E_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{f}}$ or $E_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{b}}$, for the forward or backward reaction, respectively. ${ }^{2}$

Figure 3.1.1 Simple representation of potential energy changes during a reaction.

In another notation, we can understand $E_{\mathrm{A}}$ as the change in standard internal energy in going from one of the minima to the maximum, which is often called the transition state or activated complex. We might then identify that $E_{\mathrm{A}}$ as the standard internal energy of activation, $\Delta E^{\ddagger}$. The standard enthalpy of activation, $\Delta H^{\ddagger}$, would then be $\Delta E^{\ddagger}+\Delta(P V)^{\ddagger}$, but $\Delta(P V)$ is usually negligible in a condensed-phase reaction, so that $\Delta H^{\ddagger} \approx \Delta E^{\ddagger}$. Thus, the Arrhenius equation could be recast as

$$
\begin{equation*}
k=A e^{-\Delta H^{\ddagger} / R T} \tag{3.1.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

We are free also to factor the coefficient $A$ into the product $A^{\prime} \exp \left(\Delta S^{\ddagger} / R\right)$, because the exponential involving the standard entropy of activation, $\Delta S^{\ddagger}$, is a dimensionless constant. Then

$$
\begin{equation*}
k=A^{\prime} e^{-\left(\Delta H^{\ddagger}-T \Delta S^{\ddagger}\right) / R T} \tag{3.1.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
k=A^{\prime} e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger} / R T} \tag{3.1.9}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Delta G^{\ddagger}$ is the standard free energy of activation. ${ }^{3}$ This relation, like (3.1.7), is an equivalent statement of the Arrhenius equation, (3.1.6), which itself is an empirical generalization of reality. Equations 3.1.7 and 3.1.9 are derived from (3.1.6), but only by the interpretation we apply to the phenomenological constant $E_{\mathrm{A}}$. Nothing we have written so far depends on a specific theory of kinetics.

## 3.1.3 Transition State Theory

Many theories of kinetics have been constructed to illuminate the factors controlling reaction rates. A prime goal is to predict the values of $A$ and $E_{\mathrm{A}}$ for specific chemical systems in terms of quantitative molecular properties. An important general theory that has been adapted for electrode kinetics is the transition state theory (1-5), also known as the activated complex theory.

[^2]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-04.jpg?height=542&width=810&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=187)
Figure 3.1.2 Free-energy changes during a reaction. The activated complex (or transition state) is the configuration of maximum free energy on the favored reaction path.

Central to this approach is the idea that reactions proceed through a well-defined transition state or activated complex, as shown in Figure 3.1.2. The standard free-energy change in going from the reactants to the complex is $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$, while the complex is elevated above the products by $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$.

Let us consider the system of (3.1.1), in which two substances, A and B , are linked by unimolecular reactions. First, we focus on the special condition in which the entire system-A, B, and all other configurations-is at thermal equilibrium. For this situation, the concentration of activated complexes can be calculated according to either of two equilibrium constants:

$$
\begin{align*}
& \frac{\text { [Complex] }}{\text { [A] }}=\frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{A}} / C^{0}}{\gamma_{\ddagger} / C^{0}} K_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{A}}}{\gamma_{\ddagger}} \exp \left(-\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger} / R T\right)  \tag{3.1.10}\\
& \frac{\text { [Complex] }}{\text { [B] }}=\frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{B}} / C^{0}}{\gamma_{\ddagger} / C^{0}} K_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{\gamma_{\mathrm{B}}}{\gamma_{\ddagger}} \exp \left(-\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger} / R T\right) \tag{3.1.11}
\end{align*}
$$

where $C^{0}$ is the concentration of the standard state, and $\gamma_{\mathrm{A}}, \gamma_{\mathrm{B}}$, and $\gamma_{\ddagger}$ are dimensionless activity coefficients (Section 2.1.5). Normally, we assume that the system is ideal, so that the activity coefficients approach unity and fall out of (3.1.10) and (3.1.11).

The activated complexes decay into either A or B according to a combined rate constant, $k^{\prime}$, and can be divided into four fractions: (a) those created from A and reverting back to A , $f_{\mathrm{AA}}$, (b) those arising from A and decaying to B , $f_{\mathrm{AB}}$, (c) those created from B and decaying to $\mathrm{A}, f_{\mathrm{BA}}$, and (d) those arising from B and reverting back to $\mathrm{B}, f_{\mathrm{BB}}$. Thus, $f_{\mathrm{AA}}+f_{\mathrm{AB}}+ f_{\mathrm{BA}}+f_{\mathrm{BB}}=1$, and the rates of transforming A into B and vice versa are

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}[\mathrm{~A}]=f_{\mathrm{AB}} k^{\prime}[\text { Complex }]  \tag{3.1.12a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}[\mathrm{~B}]=f_{\mathrm{BA}} k^{\prime}[\text { Complex }] \tag{3.1.12b}
\end{align*}
$$

Since we require $k_{\mathrm{f}}[\mathrm{A}]=k_{\mathrm{b}}[\mathrm{B}]$ at equilibrium, $f_{\mathrm{AB}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{BA}}$ must be the same. In the simplest version of the theory, both are taken as $1 / 2$. This assumption implies that $f_{\mathrm{AA}}=f_{\mathrm{BB}}=0$; thus, complexes are not considered as reverting to the source state. Instead, any system reaching the activated configuration continues to proceed in the direction opposite the source. In a more flexible version, the fractions $f_{\mathrm{AB}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{BA}}$ are equated to $\kappa / 2$, where $\kappa$, the transmission coefficient, can take a value from zero to unity.

Substitution for the concentration of the complex from (3.1.10) and (3.1.11) into (3.1.12a) and (3.1.12b), respectively, leads to the rate constants:

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{\kappa k^{\prime}}{2} e^{-\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger} / R T}  \tag{3.1.13a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{\kappa k^{\prime}}{2} e^{-\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger} / R T} \tag{3.1.13b}
\end{align*}
$$

Statistical mechanics can be used to predict $k^{\prime}$. In general, it depends on the shape of the energy surface in the region of the complex, but for simple cases $k^{\prime}$ can be shown to be $2 k T / h$, where, $k$ and $h$ are the Boltzmann and Planck constants. Thus, both rate constants in (3.1.13) might be expressed in the form:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k=\kappa \frac{k T}{h} e^{-\Delta G^{\ddagger} / R T} \tag{3.1.14}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the expression most frequently seen for a rate constant in the transition state theory.
To reach (3.1.14), we considered only a system at equilibrium. However, the rate constant for an elementary process is fixed for a given temperature and pressure and does not depend on the reactant and product concentrations. Equation 3.1.14 is, therefore, a general expression. If it holds at equilibrium, it will hold away from equilibrium. The assumption of equilibrium, though useful in the derivation, does not constrain the equation's range of validity (2). ${ }^{4}$
