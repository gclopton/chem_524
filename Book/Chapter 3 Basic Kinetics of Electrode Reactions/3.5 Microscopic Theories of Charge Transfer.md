# 3.5 Microscopic Theories of Charge Transfer

In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we explored the most common description of heterogeneous electrontransfer kinetics, the Butler-Volmer model, in which the rate of a reaction is expressed in terms of two phenomenological parameters, $k^{0}$ and $\alpha$. The BV approach has proven useful for organizing experimental results and for providing diagnostic information about reaction mechanisms; however, it cannot support detailed chemical thinking about the reacting species, the solvent, the electrode material, or adsorbed layers on the electrode.

To go further, one needs a microscopic theory describing the effects of molecular structure and environment on the electron-transfer step. The goal is to make predictions that can be tested by experiments, so that one can grasp the fundamental factors causing reactions to be kinetically facile or sluggish. With such understanding, there would be a firmer basis for designing superior systems for many scientific and technological purposes.

Major contributions in that direction have been made by Marcus (39-43), Hush (44-46), Levich (47), Dogonadze (48), and many others. Comprehensive reviews are available (49-57). The presentation below is largely based on the Marcus model, which has been widely applied in electrochemical studies and has demonstrated the ability to support useful predictions with minimal computation. Marcus was recognized with the 1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his contributions.

## 3.5.1 Inner-Sphere and Outer-Sphere Electrode Reactions

Taube (58) introduced the terms inner-sphere and outer-sphere to describe broad classes of homogeneous electron-transfer reactions of coordination compounds (Figure 3.5.1). In his usage, "outer-sphere" denotes a reaction in which the original coordination spheres of the reactants remain intact in the activated complex, so that the reaction can be understood as "electron transfer from one primary bond system to another" (58). In distinction, a homogenous "inner-sphere" reaction occurs in an activated complex where the ions share a ligand ["electron transfer within a primary bond system" (58)].

By analogy, we transfer these ideas into the domain of electrode reactions:

- In an elementary outer-sphere electrode reaction, the reactant and product do not interact chemically with the electrode surface, but remain at least a solvent layer away (Figure 3.5.1a). A typical example is the heterogeneous reduction of $\mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{3+}$, where the reactant at the electrode surface is considered to be essentially the same as in the bulk.
- In an elementary inner-sphere electrode reaction, the electrode surface becomes a chemical component of the reacting system, and the path from reactants to products involves specific adsorption (Sections 1.6.3 and 14.3.4). One type of inner-sphere reaction features a specifically adsorbed anion that serves as a ligand bridge (59) to a metal ion (Figure 3.5.1b). The mechanisms for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution at Pt involve inner-sphere elementary steps (Figure 3.5.1c and Chapter 15).

Figure 3.5.1 Outer-sphere and inner-sphere reactions. The inner-sphere homogeneous reaction produces, with loss of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, a ligand-bridged complex (shown above), which decomposes to $\mathrm{CrCl}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{5}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{5}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)^{2+}$. Heterogeneous reactions: (a) A metal ion (M) surrounded by ligands, spaced away from the electrode by a solvent layer. (b) A metal complex having a bridging ligand that also adsorbs on the electrode (dark shaded), e.g., the oxidation of $\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{5}^{2+}$ at a mercury electrode in the presence of halide. (c) End-on adsorption of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on a metal electrode during the oxygen reduction reaction.

The kinetics of inner-sphere reactions are typically strongly dependent on the electrode material, while those of inner-sphere reactions are much less so. ${ }^{15}$

Outer-sphere processes can be treated generally, and the remaining discussion in this section focuses on them.

Inner-sphere electrode reactions are deferred to Chapter 15. These processes resist generalization, because they implicate specific, varied chemical interactions. Even so, a theoretical approach to inner-sphere electrode reactions remains an important goal-not least because they are critical in practical applications, such as fuel cells and batteries. A useful treatment must comprehend specific adsorption, as well as other factors commonly encountered in heterogeneous catalysis (60).

## 3.5.2 Extended Charge Transfer and Adiabaticity

It is worthwhile to consider whether a reactant can undergo electron transfer at different distances from an electrode and, if so, how the rate might depend on distance and on the nature of the intervening medium.

### (a) Electron Tunneling

The electron transfer itself can be understood as the tunneling of an electron between a state in the electrode and a state on the reactant. The probability of tunneling declines as $\exp (-\beta x)$ with increasing distance, $x$, where the factor $\beta$ depends upon the height of the energy barrier and the nature of the medium between the states. For example, for tunneling between two pieces of metal through vacuum (61)

$$
\begin{equation*}
\beta \approx 4 \pi(2 m \Phi)^{1 / 2} / h \approx 10.2 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1} \mathrm{eV}^{-1 / 2} \times \Phi^{1 / 2} \tag{3.5.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the electron ( $9.1 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~g}$ ), and $\Phi$ is the work function of the metal, typically given in eV . For Pt , where $\Phi \approx 5.7 \mathrm{eV}, \beta$ is about $24 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1}$.

[^9]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-24.jpg?height=516&width=833&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=189)
Figure 3.5.2 Schematic diagram of an adsorbed monolayer of alkane thiol containing similar molecules with attached electroactive groups held by the film at a fixed distance from the electrode surface.

It is possible to study electron transfer to an electroreactant held at a fixed distance ( $1-3 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) from an electrode surface by a spacer, such as an adsorbed monolayer (Section 17.6.2). One approach is based on the use of a blocking layer, such as a self-assembled monolayer of an alkane thiol or an insulating oxide film, to define the distance of closest approach of a dissolved reactant to the electrode (62-64). This strategy requires knowledge of the precise thickness of the blocking layer and assurance that the layer is free of pinholes and defects, through which a dissolved electroreactant might penetrate (Section 17.6.1). Alternatively, the adsorbed monolayer may itself contain electroactive groups (65-73). A typical layer of this kind involves an alkane thiol (RSH) with a terminal ferrocene group ( -Fc ), i.e., $\mathrm{HS}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{n} \mathrm{OOCFc}$ (often written as $\mathrm{HSC}_{n} \mathrm{OOCFc}$; typically $n=8-18$ ) (Figure 3.5.2). Such molecules are often diluted in the monolayer film with similar electroinactive molecules (e.g., $\mathrm{HSC}_{n} \mathrm{CH}_{3}$ ). The rate constant is measured as a function of the length of the alkyl chain, and the slope of the plot of $\ln k v s . n$ or $x$ allows determination of $\beta$.

For saturated chains, $\beta$ is typically in the range of $10-12 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1}$. Since $\exp (-\beta x)$ is greater at any distance for a smaller value of $\beta$, the difference between this through-bond value and that for vacuum (through-space), $\sim 20 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1}$, suggests the facilitation of tunneling by the intervening molecular bonds. Even smaller $\beta$ values ( $3-6 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1}$ ) have been seen with $\pi$-conjugated spacers [e.g., those with phenyleneethynyl ( $-\mathrm{Ph}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-$ ) units] (69, 70).

In electron-transfer theory, the tunneling probability is included in the prefactor of the rate constant as the electronic transmission coefficient, $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$ (57) [Sections 3.1.3 and 3.5.3(b)]. Often, its dependence on distance is expressed as:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}(x)=\exp \left[-\beta\left(x-x_{\mathrm{a}}\right)\right] & \left(x \geq x_{\mathrm{a}}\right) \\
\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}(x)=1 & \left(x<x_{\mathrm{a}}\right) \tag{3.5.3}
\end{array}
$$

where $x_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the distance from the electrode where electronic coupling between the electroreactant and the electrode becomes sufficient for the reaction to be adiabatic, a concept that we will develop next. Thus, $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}=1$ when $x$ becomes as small as $x_{\mathrm{a}}$ (or even smaller). For larger separations than $x_{\mathrm{a}}$, the tunneling probability falls off exponentially. This approximation fits real cases (65, 66, 68-70), but more complex functions of distance may be used instead (63).

### (b) Adiabatic and Nonadiabatic Reactions

In the theory of reaction kinetics, the extent of electronic interaction between two reactants in mutual proximity (or, in our case, between a reactant and the electrode) has important effects on the energy surfaces describing the system. Because of the electronic coupling, the surfaces do not make a simple intersection, such as we drew in Figures 3.3.1 and 3.3.2. Instead, they avoid crossing and separate at the point of intersection (Figure 3.5.3). The gap between the surfaces at the reaction coordinate where intersection would otherwise have occurred is called the surface splitting or curve splitting. Its magnitude is $2 H_{\mathrm{ab}}$, where $H_{\mathrm{ab}}$ is the electronic coupling matrix element (74). The coupling lowers the energy of the activated complex along the main reaction path by $H_{\mathrm{ab}}$ and raises the energy of the minimum formed by the upper parts of the intersecting surfaces by the same amount. There are two limiting situations:

- If the electronic coupling is strong, ${ }^{16}$ the gap, $2 H_{\mathrm{ab}}$, exceeds $k T$. Figure 3.5.3a depicts the effect for the heterogeneous case. There is a lower surface (or curve) proceeding continuously from O to R and an upper surface (or curve) describing an excited state. Since the two surfaces are energetically well separated, a reacting system will nearly always remain on the lower surface, with momentum along the $q$-axis assuring that the system proceeds from O to R (or vice versa) with $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}} \rightarrow 1$. The reaction is said to be adiabatic, meaning that it remains on a single surface.
- If the electronic coupling is small (e.g., when the electroreactant is spaced away from the electrode surface), the splitting of the energy surfaces at the point of intersection is less than $k T$, as in Figure 3.5.3b. Momentum along the $q$-axis and the lack of an appreciable energy barrier lead the system to remain on the original $\mathrm{O}+e$ surface-or, actually, to cross from the ground-state surface to the excited-state surface. Accordingly, there is a reduced likelihood

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-25.jpg?height=591&width=1210&top_left_y=1242&top_left_x=189)
Figure 3.5.3 Splitting of energy curves (energy surfaces) for an outer-sphere electrode reaction in the intersection region. The splittings shown here are equal to $2 \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{ab}}$. (a) A strong interaction between O and the electrode leads to a well-defined, continuous curve (surface) connecting $\mathrm{O}+e$ with R . If the reacting system reaches the transition state, the probability is high that it will proceed into the valley corresponding to $R$, as indicated by the curved arrow. (b) A weak interaction leads to a splitting less than $k T$. When the reacting system approaches the transition state from the left, it tends to remain on the $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve, as indicated by the straight arrow. The probability of crossover to the R curve can be small. These curves are drawn for an electrode reaction, but the principle is the same for a homogeneous reaction, where the reactants and products might be $\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$, respectively.

[^10]that the system will proceed from O to R . The process is said to be nonadiabatic, meaning that it involves a crossing from one surface to another. The probability of successful reaction ( O becoming R , or vice versa) per passage through the intersection region depends on $H_{\mathrm{ab}}$ and is expressed by $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}<1$ (57). If, for example, an electroreactant were spaced away by 1 nm from the plane of adiabatic reaction at an electrode (i.e., if $x-x_{\mathrm{a}}=1 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), and if $\beta$ were $10 \mathrm{~nm}^{-1}$, then according to (3.5.2), the tunneling probability would be $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}=e^{-10}=4.5 \times 10^{-5}$. On average, the reactants would have to pass through the intersection region (reach the transition state) about 22,000 times for every successful electron transfer.

For electrode reactions involving dissolved electroreactants, one can view the reaction as occurring over a range of distances, with the rate constant falling exponentially with distance. Electron transfer occurs in a three-dimensional zone near the electrode, rather than only in a single plane of closest approach; however, the effect for dissolved electroreactants is predicted to be distinguishable experimentally only under restricted circumstances (e.g., $D_{\mathrm{O}}<10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ ) (75). In systems with normal diffusivities, the integral of events taking place at extended distances (mostly with $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}} \ll 1$ ) does not appreciably add to those taking place at closest approach (where $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}=1$ ), because all molecules in the extended electron-transfer zone (within several times $1 / \beta$ ) can make a close approach on the relevant timescale, which is the reaction lifetime of a molecule at the surface (Problem 3.6). If the diffusivity is very small, this is no longer true, and extended electron transfer can contribute appreciably.

## 3.5.3 The Marcus Microscopic Model

An outer-sphere, $1 e$ transfer from an electrode to species O , forming the product R , is closely related to the homogeneous reduction of O in a bimolecular reaction involving a reductant, $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ :

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{R}^{\prime} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}+\mathrm{O}^{\prime} \tag{3.5.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

We will find it convenient to consider the two situations in the same theoretical context.
The act of electron transfer, whether heterogeneous or homogeneous, is a radiationless electronic rearrangement of reacting species. Accordingly, there are many common elements between theories of electron transfer and those of deactivation in excited molecules (76). Since the transfer is radiationless, the electron must move from an initial state (on the electrode or in the reductant, $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ ) to a receiving state of the same energy (in species O ). This demand for isoenergetic electron transfer is a fundamental aspect with extensive consequences.

Another important aspect of most microscopic theories of electron transfer is the assumption that the reacting system does not alter its configuration during the actual transfer (77). This idea rests on the Franck-Condon principle, which says that nuclear momenta and positions do not change on the time scale of electronic transitions. Thus, the reactant and the product- O and R -are assumed to share a common nuclear configuration at the instant of transfer.

### (a) The Precursor State

In the early development of the Marcus theory, ${ }^{17}$ the reactants were assumed to encounter each other by hard-sphere Brownian motion, and the pre-exponential factor for the rate constant was written in terms of a collision number (39-41). Later (57, 78, 79), the model became restated in terms of a precursor state-a reactive pair (either O plus the electrode surface or O plus $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$

[^11]in solution) situated at the right distance for reaction, but not necessarily in the conformation of the activated complex. The precursor state is assumed to be at equilibrium with the separated reactants and to have a concentration described by an equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$. While formed, the precursor state acts unimolecularly-as a single entity, sampling different conformations on its potential energy surface and possibly achieving the conformation corresponding to the activated complex, where electron transfer can occur, producing R from O .

The equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$, differs for the heterogeneous and homogeneous cases:

- For a heterogeneous reduction, the precursor state, $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}$, is species O situated near the electrode, perhaps separated by the solvated radius of $\mathrm{O}, a_{\mathrm{O}}$. Then, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}=\Gamma_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}} / C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$, where $\Gamma_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}}$ is the two-dimensional concentration (in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ) of $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }} \cdot{ }^{18}$ Consequently, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$ has units of cm when $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$ is in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$.
- For a homogeneous reduction of O , the precursor state, also denoted $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}$, is the assembly $\mathrm{OR}^{\prime}$, where the separation might be the sum of the solvated radii, $a_{\mathrm{O}}+a_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}$. Then $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}= C_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}} / C_{\mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}$, which has units of $\mathrm{M}^{-1}$, if the concentrations are expressed conventionally.


### (b) Form of the Rate Constant

Whether the reaction is heterogeneous or homogeneous, the rate is given by the unimolecular decay of $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}$ to produce R , which is described by a first-order rate constant, $k_{\mathrm{f}, \text { pre }}$, having units of $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This rate constant operates on the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}$, which is two dimensional for the heterogeneous case, but three dimensional for the homogeneous case; thus, the reaction rate is

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{pre}} \Gamma_{\mathrm{O}} & \left(\text { heterogeneous, } \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right) \\
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{pre}} C_{\mathrm{O}} & \left(\text { homogeneous, } \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)
\end{array}
$$

In either case, the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}$ can be re-expressed in terms of the equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$,

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{pre}} K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) & \text { (heterogeneous) } \\
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{pre}} K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}} & \text { (homogeneous) } \tag{3.5.8}
\end{array}
$$

In conventional form, we write

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) & \text { (heterogeneous) } \\
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}} C_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}} & \text { (homogeneous) } \tag{3.5.10}
\end{array}
$$

Thus, we see that the overall forward electron-transfer rate constant, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$, has a consistent expression for both cases:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}, \mathrm{pre}} K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} \tag{3.5.11}
\end{equation*}
$$

If $k_{\mathrm{f} \text {, pre }}$ adheres to the Arrhenius form, (3.1.9), then

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{f}}=K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} A^{\prime} \exp \left(-\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger} / R T\right) \tag{3.5.12}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ is the free energy of activation for the "forward" process (the reduction of O ), and $A^{\prime}$ is a frequency factor with units of $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

[^12]The prefactor, $A^{\prime}$, has been factored and expressed in many ways in the literature. Here, we follow a common notation (57) and set $A^{\prime}=\nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$, where $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ is the nuclear frequency factor $\left(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\right)$, representing the frequency of attempts on the energy barrier (generally associated with changes in bond lengths, rotations about bonds, and solvent motion); and $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$ is the electronic transmission coefficient [related to the probability of electron tunneling; Section 3.5.2(a)]. With this elaboration, the rate constant for reduction can be expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{f}}=K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} \nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}} \exp \left(-\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger} / R T\right) \tag{3.5.13}
\end{equation*}
$$

As noted, this relationship applies to either a heterogeneous reduction at an electrode or a homogeneous electron transfer in which O is reduced by another reactant in solution. For the heterogeneous case, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$ has units of cm , so $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ is in $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$, as required. For a homogeneous process, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$ has units of $\mathrm{M}^{-1}$; therefore, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ is in $\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, again as required.

The pre-exponential factors have been reviewed systematically (57, 80). ${ }^{19}$ Methods for estimating them are available, but there is considerable uncertainty in their values.

Normally, $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$ is taken as unity for an adiabatic process-a reaction in which the reactant is close to the electrode and significant electronic coupling exists between the reactant and the electrode. ${ }^{20}$ Nonadiabatic electron-transfer reactions, generally involving tunneling across a spatial separation of the reactant and electrode (or of two homogeneous reactants), are treated by using (3.5.2) or some other expression to define $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$. In such cases, $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$ is usually orders of magnitude less than unity.

### (c) Conformational Change and Activation Energy

Now let us focus on events in the precursor state, which evolves on a multidimensional surface defining the standard free energy of the system in terms of the relative positions of the atoms. Before the electron transfer occurs, we envision the precursor state essentially as species O at the reactive distance from either the electrode or from $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$. Let us call this the "O configuration." After electron transfer, the same assembly of atoms is, in essence, species $R$ at the reactive distance from either the electrode or $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$. This we call the " R configuration." A transition from the O configuration to the R configuration, or vice versa, corresponds to electron transfer, which can happen only when the precursor state distorts itself into a form that is common to the O and R configurations. ${ }^{21}$

The mean separation of the two main components of the precursor state (e.g., the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ frame plus the electrode) is assumed to remain constant during the life of the precursor state. Thus, changes in nuclear coordinates come about from vibrational and rotational motion, rather than relative translation of the two main parts.

Marcus examined the manner in which the free-energy surfaces of the O and R configurations depend upon all vibrational and rotational modes (41). He was able to show that, along the most likely reaction path, the standard free energies of the two configurations, $G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}$ and $G_{\mathrm{R}}^{0}$, behave simply, depending quadratically on a single effective coordinate, $q(41,54)$ :

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}(q)=(k / 2)\left(q-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2} & (\mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}) \\
G_{\mathrm{R}}^{0}(q)=(k / 2)\left(q-q_{\mathrm{R}}\right)^{2}+\Delta G^{0} & (\mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}) \tag{3.5.15}
\end{array}
$$

[^13]Here, $q_{\mathrm{O}}$ and $q_{\mathrm{R}}$ are the values of the coordinate for the equilibrium O and R configurations, and $k$ has the character of a force constant. It is natural to refer to the Marcus coordinate, $q$, as the "reaction coordinate," and we employ that term below. In (3.5.15), $\Delta G^{0}$ is either $F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$ for an electrode reaction ${ }^{22}$ or the overall free-energy change for a homogeneous electron transfer, depending on the case under consideration. ${ }^{23}$

On the basis of (3.5.14) and (3.5.15), one can represent a reacting system in terms of two intersecting parabolas in a plot of standard free energy vs. the Marcus coordinate, as illustrated in Figure 3.5.4a for the heterogeneous case. The activated complex is the position where

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-29.jpg?height=921&width=706&top_left_y=617&top_left_x=199)
Figure 3.5.4 (a) Standard free energy vs. Marcus coordinate for an electron-transfer reaction in a precursor complex, e.g., for $\mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{3+}+e \rightarrow \mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{2+}$. Labeled for a heterogeneous reaction, but also applicable to the homogeneous case (see text). The curve for the O configuration includes the energy of an electron on the electrode at the Fermi energy corresponding to potential $E$. Curve splitting near the activated complex is depicted. It creates a lower-energy path connecting O and R (solid curve), plus an excited state (dashed line). (b) Schematic depiction of structural alterations accompanying electron transfer, e.g., changes in bond lengths within the electroactive species or the restructuring of the solvent shell. (c) As the reaction path is traversed from $q_{\mathrm{O}}$ to $q_{\mathrm{R}}$ (or vice versa), the chemical identity of the complex changes as indicated in the shaded bar. Electron transfer occurs only when the precursor state attains a conformation that is common to the energy surfaces for both $\mathrm{O}+e$ and R .

[^14]distorted O and R configurations have the same structure and energy, viz. the intersection point at $q^{\ddagger}$. The reaction path for the forward process proceeds rightward along the $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve from $q_{\mathrm{O}}$, through the activated complex at $q^{\ddagger}$, where the electron transfer happens, then along the R curve until the minimum at $q_{\mathrm{R}}$ is reached.

Figure 3.5.4a also applies to the homogeneous case, where the curve for the O configuration describes $O$ and its reactant partner, $R^{\prime}$, while the curve for the $R$ configuration describes $R$ and $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ together. Then, the energy difference between the minima is $\Delta G^{0}$ for the reaction.

Figure 3.5.4 $b$ is a stylized representation of the stable configurations of the participants (perhaps $\mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ru}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{6}^{2+}$ as species O and R at an electrode). This diagram also symbolically expresses the change in nuclear configuration upon reduction.

The free energies at the transition state are given by ${ }^{24}$

$$
\begin{align*}
& G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}\left(q^{\ddagger}\right)=(k / 2)\left(q^{\ddagger}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2}  \tag{3.5.16}\\
& G_{\mathrm{R}}^{0}\left(q^{\ddagger}\right)=(k / 2)\left(q^{\ddagger}-q_{\mathrm{R}}\right)^{2}+\Delta G^{0} \tag{3.5.17}
\end{align*}
$$

Since $G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}\left(q^{\ddagger}\right)=G_{\mathrm{R}}^{0}\left(q^{\ddagger}\right)$, (3.5.16) and (3.5.17) can be solved for $q^{\ddagger}$ with the following result:

$$
\begin{equation*}
q^{\ddagger}=\frac{\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}+q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)}{2}+\frac{\Delta G^{0}}{k\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)} \tag{3.5.18}
\end{equation*}
$$

The free energy of activation for reduction is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}\left(q^{\ddagger}\right) \tag{3.5.19}
\end{equation*}
$$

since all free energies are referenced to $G_{\mathrm{O}}^{0}\left(q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)=0$, as defined in (3.5.14). Substitution for $q^{\ddagger}$ from (3.5.18) into (3.5.16) followed by rearrangement yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{k\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2}}{8}\left[1+\frac{2 \Delta G^{0}}{k\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2}}\right]^{2} \tag{3.5.20}
\end{equation*}
$$

Defining $\lambda=(k / 2)\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2}$, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}\left[1+\frac{F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}{\lambda}\right]^{2} \quad \text { (electrode reaction) } \tag{3.5.21}
\end{equation*}
$$

If work is required to bring the reactants or the products together (e.g., to bring a positively charged reactant to a reactive position at a positively charged electrode), that work is part of the overall standard free energy of reaction, but is not included in Figure 3.5.4a, which describes only the precursor state. Expressed more completely, the energy difference between the minima in Figure 3.5.4 is $\Delta G^{0}+w_{\mathrm{R}}-w_{\mathrm{O}}$, where $w_{\mathrm{O}}$ and $w_{\mathrm{R}}$ are the work terms expressing, respectively, the free energy required to form the O configuration of the precursor complex from separated O -side components ( O and either the electrode or $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ ) and the free energy required to form the R configuration from separated R -side components ( R and either the electrode or $\mathrm{O}^{\prime}$ ). For simplicity, the work terms were omitted in the derivation above, but they can be included by replacing $\Delta G^{0}$ everywhere in (3.5.15)-(3.5.22) with $\Delta G^{0}+\Delta w$, where $\Delta w=w_{\mathrm{R}}-w_{\mathrm{O}}$. For an

[^15]electrode reaction, the replacement is $F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)+\Delta w$. The complete equations, including the work terms, are, therefore, ${ }^{25}$
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}\left(1+\frac{F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)+\Delta w}{\lambda}\right)^{2} & \text { (electrode reaction) } \\
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}\left(1+\frac{\Delta G^{0}+\Delta w}{\lambda}\right)^{2} & \text { (homogeneous reaction) } \tag{3.5.24}
\end{array}
$$

### (d) Reorganization Energy

A key parameter in the Marcus theory is $\lambda$, the reorganization energy, which quantifies the energy requirement for restructuring the precursor complex. The broad, gray arrow on the right side of Figure 3.5.4a illustrates the scale of $\lambda$, which is not the same as the activation energy in either direction, but is a parameter determining the activation energies. We saw just above that $\lambda$ is defined as $(k / 2)\left(q_{\mathrm{R}}-q_{\mathrm{O}}\right)^{2}$; thus, it is physically the free-energy change required to distort the O configuration, without transferring an electron, from its energy minimum at $q_{\mathrm{O}}$ to the coordinate, $q_{\mathrm{R}}$, corresponding to the energy minimum of the R configuration. This relationship is depicted in Figure 3.5.4a.

The reorganization energy is usually separated into "inner" and "outer" components, $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$, respectively:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda=\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}+\lambda_{\mathrm{o}} \tag{3.5.25}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ relates to the central elements of the precursor state (reactants, products, or electrode), and $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$, to peripheral elements, mainly the solvent. ${ }^{26}$

To the extent that the normal modes of the precursor complex remain harmonic over the range of distortion needed, one can, in principle, calculate $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ by summing over the normal vibrational modes of the complex, that is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}=\sum_{j} 1 / 2 k_{j}\left(q_{\mathrm{O}, j}-q_{\mathrm{R}, j}\right)^{2} \tag{3.5.26}
\end{equation*}
$$

where the $k$ 's are force constants, and the $q$ 's are displacements in the normal mode coordinates.
Typically, $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$ is computed by assuming that the solvent is a dielectric continuum and the reactant is a sphere (41). For an electrode reaction in which species O is reduced,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}=\frac{e^{2}}{8 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{a_{\mathrm{O}}}-\frac{1}{R}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{op}}}-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}}\right) \tag{3.5.27}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $a_{\mathrm{O}}$ is the solvated radius of species O , and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{op}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}$ are the optical and static dielectric constants, respectively. The distance $R$ is twice the distance from the center of the molecule to the electrode, which is the distance between the center of the reactant and the center of its image charge in the electrode. ${ }^{27}$ In the usual case, where the electrode reaction is assumed to happen

[^16]at the plane of closest approach, $R=2 a_{\mathrm{O}}$. For a homogeneous electron-transfer reaction:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}=\frac{e^{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{1}{2 a_{1}}+\frac{1}{2 a_{2}}-\frac{1}{d}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{op}}}-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}}\right) \tag{3.5.28}
\end{equation*}
$$
where $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are the solvated radii of the reactants ( O and $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ in equation 3.5.4) and $d$ is the distance between the centers of the reactants in the precursor complex. Normally, $d=a_{1}+a_{2}$.

Typical values of $\lambda$ are in the range of $30-150 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}(0.3-1.5 \mathrm{eV} /$ molecule, normally expressed as " $0.3-1.5 \mathrm{eV}$ "). ${ }^{28}$ The component $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$ is commonly $0.3-0.5 \mathrm{eV}$. For an electroreactant near an electrode, evidence has been presented (81) that the value of $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$ is spatially dependent and can become as small as 0.1 eV when the separation from the electrode is reduced to 0.4 nm .

In classic Marcus theory, the reorganization energy is the same on both sides of the reaction path. A recent adaptation (82) allows the O configuration and the R configuration to have different reorganization energies, in recognition that significantly different sets of force constants might apply on the two sides of the precursor complex.

## 3.5.4 Implications of the Marcus Theory

In principle, it is possible to estimate the rate constant for an electrode reaction by computation of the pre-exponential terms and the $\lambda$ values; however, this is rarely done in practice. The greater value of the Marcus theory is in the chemical and physical insight that it affords, which is based on the predicted behavior of activation energy with changes in $\lambda$ or electrode potential.

### (a) Comparison to Butler-Volmer Kinetics

For electrochemistry, a principal point of interest is how the Marcus theory's description of heterogeneous kinetics differs from that of the Butler-Volmer model. To address that issue, we begin with the same electrode reaction used for construction of the BV model,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+e \underset{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{\stackrel{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{R} \tag{3.5.29}
\end{equation*}
$$

From Marcus theory, we can re-express $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ from (3.5.23) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}+\frac{F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)+\Delta w}{2}+\frac{\left[F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)+\Delta w\right]^{2}}{4 \lambda} \tag{3.5.30}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\Delta w=w_{\mathrm{R}}-w_{\mathrm{O}}$. Equation 3.5.30 can be expanded, then factored to isolate the potentialdependent terms, with the following result:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}+\frac{\Delta w}{2}+\frac{\Delta w^{2}}{4 \lambda}+\left[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}{4 \lambda}+\frac{\Delta w}{2 \lambda}\right] F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) \tag{3.5.31}
\end{equation*}
$$

If we identify $\alpha$ as the factor in brackets,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\alpha=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}{4 \lambda}+\frac{\Delta w}{2 \lambda} \tag{3.5.32}
\end{equation*}
$$

[^17]then
$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}+\frac{\Delta w}{2}+\frac{\Delta w^{2}}{4 \lambda}+\alpha F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) \tag{3.5.33}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the backward reaction, we find from (3.5.16) and (3.5.17)-or just from inspection of Figure 3.5.4-that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}=\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}-\Delta G^{0}=\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}-F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)-\Delta w \tag{3.5.34}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}-\frac{\Delta w}{2}+\frac{\Delta w^{2}}{4 \lambda}-(1-\alpha) F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) \tag{3.5.35}
\end{equation*}
$$

The expressions for $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$ derived from Marcus theory, (3.5.33) and (3.5.35), have the same form as in the BV model [(3.3.3) and (3.3.4)], except that $\alpha$ is not a constant in the Marcus theory, but depends on potential according to (3.5.32).

Using (3.5.13) with (3.5.33) and (3.5.35), we can express the two rate constants as

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} \nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}} e^{-\lambda / 4 R T} e^{-\Delta w / 2 R T} e^{-\Delta w^{2} / 4 \lambda R T} e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}  \tag{3.5.36}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{R}} \nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}} e^{-\lambda / 4 R T} e^{\Delta w / 2 R T} e^{-\Delta w^{2} / 4 \lambda R T} e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.5.37}
\end{align*}
$$

When $E=E^{0^{\prime}}$, these rate constants comprise only the factors preceding the last exponential. Since $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}=e^{-w_{\mathrm{O}} / R T}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{R}}=e^{-w_{\mathrm{R}} / R T}$ (footnote 25), we find the same result in either case:

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{f}}\left(E^{0^{\prime}}\right)=k_{\mathrm{b}}\left(E^{0^{\prime}}\right)=k^{0}=v_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}} e^{-\lambda / 4 R T} e^{-\left(w_{\mathrm{O}}+w_{\mathrm{R}}\right) / 2 R T} e^{-\Delta w^{2} / 4 \lambda R T} \tag{3.5.38}
\end{equation*}
$$

Thus, we have verified the equality of $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ at $E^{0^{\prime}}$, which must be true for any valid kinetic model, as shown in Section 3.3.2.

Now, we can write (3.5.36) and (3.5.37) in the familiar forms:

$$
\begin{align*}
& k_{\mathrm{f}}=k^{0} e^{-\alpha f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}  \tag{3.5.39a}\\
& k_{\mathrm{b}}=k^{0} e^{(1-\alpha) f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)} \tag{3.5.39b}
\end{align*}
$$

From (3.5.39a,b) flow the implications of the BV model presented in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Many, but not all, important BV equations also apply to Marcus kinetics. Here is a summary of particulars:

1) The BV $i-E$ characteristic, (3.3.8), is valid for Marcus kinetics, but with a potentialdependent $\alpha$ defined by (3.5.32).
2) The Nernst equation, (3.4.3), falls out of the $i-E$ characteristic for Marcus kinetics at $i=0$, just as for BV kinetics.
3) The general BV equation for the exchange current, (3.4.6), also applies for Marcus kinetics, but $\alpha$ must be taken as $\alpha_{\mathrm{eq}}$, the value at $E=E_{\mathrm{eq}}$. The BV equation for the special case of $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}=C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*},(3.4 .7)$, is valid for Marcus kinetics.
4) The BV current-overpotential equation, (3.4.10), is not generally applicable to Marcus kinetics, even with recognition of the potential-dependent $\alpha$. One can show (Problem 3.13) that the $i-\eta$ equation for Marcus kinetics is

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{0} e^{-F^{2} \eta\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right) / 4 \lambda R T}\left[\frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}} e^{-\alpha f \eta}-\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} e^{(1-\alpha) f \eta}\right] \tag{3.5.40}
\end{equation*}
$$

For the important special case of $E_{\text {eq }}=E^{0^{\prime}}$, the $i-\eta$ equation for Marcus kinetics adopts the same form as for BV kinetics. To use (3.5.40), one needs $\alpha$ as a function of $\eta$. Equation 3.5.32 is easily re-expressed as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\alpha=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{F \eta}{4 \lambda}+\frac{\Delta w}{2 \lambda}+\frac{F\left(E_{\mathrm{eq}}-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}{4 \lambda} \tag{3.5.41}
\end{equation*}
$$

5) In general, BV equations written in terms of $\eta$ or $i_{0}$ [including the Tafel equation, (3.4.15), the exchange-current relationships in Section 3.4.4, and the mass-transfer-limited relationships in Section 3.4.6] are not directly applicable to Marcus kinetics, except when $E_{\text {eq }}=E^{0^{\prime}}$. Complications arise in the use of BV equations for Marcus kinetics whenever potentials are referenced in the equations to $E_{\text {eq }} \neq E^{0^{\prime}}$.
6) The linear BV relationships for small $\eta$, (3.4.12) and (3.4.13), are valid for Marcus kinetics.
7) In the reversible case, the $i-\eta$ equation for Marcus kinetics, (3.5.40), collapses to the nernstian relationship linking the electrode potential and surface concentrations, (3.4.28), just as for BV kinetics.

### (b) Effect of the Reorganization Energy on the Standard Rate Constant

Let us assume two reacting systems having the same values of $v_{\mathrm{n}}, \kappa_{\mathrm{el}}, w_{\mathrm{O}}$, and $w_{\mathrm{R}}$, but with different values of reorganization energy, $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$. The ratio of the corresponding standard rate constants, $k_{1}^{0}$ and $k_{2}^{0}$, can be written from (3.5.38) as

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{2}^{0} / k_{1}^{0}=e^{-\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}\right) / 4 R T} e^{-\Delta w^{2} / 4 \lambda_{2} R T} e^{\Delta w^{2} / 4 \lambda_{1} R T} \tag{3.5.42}
\end{equation*}
$$

Since $\Delta w^{2}$ is normally much less than $4 \lambda R T$, the last two exponential factors are approximately unity. Their product is even closer to unity, because the exponents are offsetting; thus, (3.5.42) becomes

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{2}^{0} / k_{1}^{0} \approx e^{-\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}\right) / 4 R T} \tag{3.5.43}
\end{equation*}
$$

or

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log \frac{k_{2}^{0}}{k_{1}^{0}} \approx-\frac{\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}}{2.303 \times 4 R T} \quad\left(\lambda_{1} \text { and } \lambda_{2} \text { in } \mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol}\right) \tag{3.5.44}
\end{equation*}
$$

It is more usual for $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$ to be considered in eV per molecule. Applying the conversion factor (division by the Faraday constant; footnote 28) to both numerator and denominator, we obtain

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log \frac{k_{2}^{0}}{k_{1}^{0}}=-\frac{F\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}\right)}{2.303 \times 4 R T} \quad\left(\lambda_{1} \text { and } \lambda_{2} \text { in } \mathrm{eV}\right) \tag{3.5.45}
\end{equation*}
$$

At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, this relationship is

$$
\begin{equation*}
\log \frac{k_{2}^{0}}{k_{1}^{0}}=-\frac{\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}\right)}{0.236} \quad\left(\lambda_{1} \text { and } \lambda_{2} \text { in } \mathrm{eV}\right) \tag{3.5.46}
\end{equation*}
$$

For each 236 meV difference between $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{2}$, there is an order of magnitude difference in the standard rate constants at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, with the larger value of $k^{0}$ corresponding to the smaller $\lambda$.

In general, $k^{0}$ will be larger for reactions in which O and R have similar structures. Electron transfers involving large structural alterations (such as sizable changes in bond lengths or bond angles) tend to be slower. Solvation also has an impact through its contribution to $\lambda$. Large molecules (large $a_{\mathrm{O}}$ ) tend to show lower solvation energies, and smaller changes in solvation upon reaction, by comparison with smaller species. On this basis, one can understand why
electron transfers to small molecules, such as the reduction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{O}_{2} \bar{\bullet}$ in aprotic media, tend to be slower than the reduction of Ar to $\mathrm{Ar} \bar{\bullet}$, where Ar is a large aromatic molecule like anthracene.

The role of the solvent in an electron transfer goes beyond its contribution to $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$. There is evidence that the dynamics of solvent reorganization, often represented in terms of a solvent longitudinal relaxation time, $\tau_{\mathrm{L}}$, contributes inversely to the pre-exponential factor in (3.5.13) (50, 53, 83-86). Since $\tau_{\mathrm{L}}$ is roughly proportional to the viscosity, the implication is that $k^{0}$ for an outer-sphere electrode reaction would decrease as the solution viscosity increases (i.e., as the diffusion coefficient of the reactant decreases). Such behavior has been reported in several cases (87-89).

### (c) Behavior of the Transfer Coefficient

Equation 3.5.32 predicts that $\alpha$ for any outer-sphere electrode reaction is $0.5+\Delta w / 2 \lambda$ at $E^{0^{\prime}}$. Since $\Delta w / 2 \lambda$ is normally small, (3.5.32) implies that $\alpha$ is typically near 0.5 at $E^{0^{\prime}}$, but changes linearly with potential, becoming smaller toward more negative potentials.

Figure 3.5.5 illustrates this behavior for three different values of reorganization energy in the expected range for outer-sphere electrode reactions [lines( $b)-(d)$ ]. The variation in $\alpha$ predicted for Marcus kinetics can cover a sizable span and is stronger for smaller $\lambda$.

Figure 3.5.5a represents $\alpha$ for BV kinetics, for which the transfer coefficient is invariant with potential and is not constrained in value. It is a fully adjustable parameter for fitting data to the BV model.

For Marcus kinetics, the transfer coefficient has a fixed value $0.5+\Delta w / 2 \lambda$ at $E=E^{0^{\prime}}$. The fully adjustable parameters are $\lambda$ and $\Delta w$. In some cases, the latter can be justifiably neglected.

Experimental results consistent with these expectations of Marcus kinetics have been reported (82, 90-93).

### (d) Rate Constants and Current-Potential Curves

The potential dependence of $\alpha$ in Marcus kinetics has very significant consequences for the heterogeneous rate constants, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$. Curves ( $b$ ) and ( $c$ ) in Figure 3.5.6 illustrate the effect on

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-35.jpg?height=694&width=803&top_left_y=1476&top_left_x=199)

(a) BV kinetics, $\alpha=0.5$; (b) Marcus kinetics, $\lambda=0.4 \mathrm{eV}, \Delta w=0 \mathrm{eV}$; (c) Marcus kinetics, $\lambda=0.8 \mathrm{eV}, \Delta w=0 \mathrm{eV}$. The finely dotted section in (b) shows the prediction for the inverted region [Section 3.5.4(e)] based on activation energy alone. Nonadiabaticity would further suppress the rate constant in the inverted region, but no attempt is made to illustrate it here. Inversion is inapplicable at a metal electrode [Section 3.5.4(f)].

$k_{\mathrm{f}}$ for two cases involving Marcus kinetics. In contrast with the result for the BV model [curve (a)], $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ for the Marcus cases rolls off on both the positive and negative wings. The roll-off is greater for the smaller reorganization energy, reflecting the stronger potential-dependence of $\alpha$ for smaller $\lambda$.

For $k_{\mathrm{b}}$, the picture is essentially the same, but in mirror image, with large values of $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ at positive potentials and small values on the negative side.

For BV kinetics, $i-E$ curves are derived from the rate constants as described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. On the basis of the behavior discovered here for Marcus kinetics, we can expect $i-E$ or $i-\eta$ curves that largely coincide with those given by BV kinetics within perhaps 100 mV of $E^{0^{\prime}}$, but with significantly smaller currents on the wings. Voltammetric responses under Marcus kinetics should, therefore, be more drawn out.

These expectations are confirmed in theoretical steady-state voltammograms comprehending both kinetic and mass-transfer effects (94). In Figure 3.5.7, one can see examples computed using the method of Section 3.4.6, but with rate constants as given by Marcus kinetics. As expected (Section 3.4.6), the curves show an exaggerated inflection at $\eta=0$ when the exchange current, $i_{0}$, is much smaller than the mass-transfer-limited current. This behavior appears because $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ or $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ must be activated by a significant overpotential to deliver currents much larger in magnitude than $i_{0}$. The two frames of Figure 3.5.7 show predictions for two different ratios of $i_{0} / i_{l}$. In each frame, one can compare the expectations from BV kinetics and Marcus kinetics.

An interesting prediction (94) for sufficiently small values of $i_{0} / i_{l}$ and $\lambda$ is that Marcus kinetics never become sufficiently activated to deliver the mass-transfer-limited current, $i_{l}$. At high overpotentials, the current instead reaches a plateau at a level below $i_{l}$. One can see this behavior in Figure 3.5.7. Experimental work (63, 64) has confirmed the prediction. This behavior is in sharp contrast with the BV model, where there is no limit to rate activation at high overpotentials.

The reaction is $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ with $T=298 \mathrm{~K}, i_{l, \mathrm{c}}=-i_{l, \mathrm{a}}=i_{l}$, and $E_{\mathrm{eq}}=E^{0^{\prime}}$. Values of $i_{0} / i_{l}$ are indicated in each frame. Solid curves: BV kinetics with $\alpha=0.5$ (same as in Figure 3.4.6). Dashed curves: Marcus kinetics with $\lambda=0.4 \mathrm{eV}$ and $\Delta w=0.0 \mathrm{eV}$ [finely dotted sections for inverted regions, inapplicable at a metal electrode; Section 3.5.4(f)]. Dotted curves: Marcus kinetics with $\lambda=0.8 \mathrm{eV}$ and $\Delta w=0.0 \mathrm{eV}$. The $\alpha$-functions for the Marcus cases are presented in Figure 3.5.5.

Because $\alpha$ changes continuously in Marcus kinetics, Tafel plots are curved, not linear, as shown in Figure 3.5.8 (7). ${ }^{29}$

### (e) Inverted Regions

The Marcus theory makes a notable prediction about reactions having large driving forces. To illuminate it, let us express the cathodic activation energy for an electrode reaction in a dimensionless format:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{E-E^{0^{\prime}}+\Delta w}{\lambda}\right)^{2} \quad(\text { energies in } \mathrm{eV}) \tag{3.5.47}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation is obtained from (3.5.23) by dividing both sides by $\lambda$ and by understanding $\lambda$, $\Delta w$, and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ to be in eV . In a similar manner, we can also express the anodic activation energy dimensionlessly:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{E-E^{0^{\prime}}+\Delta w}{\lambda}\right)^{2}-\frac{E-E^{0^{\prime}}+\Delta w}{\lambda} \quad(\text { energies in } \mathrm{eV}) \tag{3.5.48}
\end{equation*}
$$

Figure 3.5.9, showing $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger} / \lambda$ and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger} / \lambda v s .\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}+\Delta w\right) / \lambda$, is a universal presentation, applicable to all outer-sphere $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ electrode reactions, regardless of their particular values of $\lambda, \Delta w$, or $E^{0^{\prime}}$.

Let us focus now on the behavior of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ (solid curve). At the vertical axis, the potential is $E^{0^{\prime}}-\Delta w$. As $E$ moves more positively from there (toward the left), $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ rises monotonically, and the corresponding rate constant, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$, would steadily fall, generally as one sees in Figure 3.5.6 for a specific case, and qualitatively the same as for BV kinetics.

Figure 3.5.9 Dimensionless presentation of activation energies for an electrode reaction vs. potential, also indicating the normal and inverted regions for cathodic and anodic directions.

As the potential is moved negatively from the vertical axis, the behavior is more complicated. If the potential remains only modestly negative, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ falls, and $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ becomes steadily larger, also as seen in Figure 3.5.6, and qualitatively as expected from the BV model. However, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ reaches zero when $\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}+\Delta w\right) / \lambda=-1$ (i.e., when $E-E^{0^{\prime}} \approx-\lambda$ ), then increases at more extreme potentials. A consequence is that $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ would not rise monotonically in the negative region (as for BV kinetics), but would flatten out near $E-E^{0^{\prime}} \approx-\lambda$, and then fall beyond that point. ${ }^{30}$ This behavior is seen in Figure 3.5.6b, which corresponds to $\lambda=0.4 \mathrm{eV}$. It is not seen in Figure 3.5.6c, corresponding to $\lambda=0.8 \mathrm{eV}$, because the depicted range of $E-E^{0^{\prime}}$ does not extend to -0.8 V .

This feature of the Marcus theory can be understood in terms of the free-energy surfaces for $\mathrm{O}+e$ and R , discussed earlier in connection with Figure 3.5.4. In Figure 3.5.10, there is an elaboration of Figure 3.5.4 showing how the relationship between the free-energy surfaces (depicted as curves) shifts as the electrode potential is changed.

Since the curve for $\mathrm{O}+e$ includes the energy of an electron on the electrode, this curve has vertical position that depends on $E$. Several different curves for $\mathrm{O}+e$ are presented in Figure 3.5.10, each corresponding to a particular potential. These curves would not change shape or location along the reaction coordinate unless the potential were to influence the structure of the precursor state. For an outer-sphere electrode reaction, any such effect is assumed to be negligible.

In contrast, the curve for $R$ is independent of potential, because $R$ is the only participant on its side of the process, and it is located entirely in solution. There is no sensitivity to the difference in potential across the interface.

In any of the cases presented in Figure 3.5.10, the cathodic activation energy, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$, is the height difference between the minimum of $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve and its intersection with the R curve. Likewise, the anodic activation energy, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$, is the height difference between the minimum of the R curve and that same intersection.

For Case 0 (solid line for $\mathrm{O}+e$ ), the potential, $E$, is at $E^{0^{\prime}}$ for the couple. Since work terms are neglected in this discussion, the minima for $\mathrm{O}+e$ and R are at the same energy, and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$. From this starting point, we proceed through the other cases:

- For Cases N1, N2, and N3 (dashed curves), $E$ is progressively more negative than $E^{0^{\prime}}$, and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ declines from Case 0 through Case N2. In the latter instance, $E=E^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$, and the intersection is exactly at the minimum of the $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve, so that $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=0$. For any more negative potential, as in Case N 3 , the intersection point is on the "back side" of the $\mathrm{O}+e$ curve ( $q^{\ddagger}<q_{\mathrm{O}}$ ), and $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ becomes steadily greater as the potential grows more extreme. Thus, we have encountered a reversal of normal trends for both $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ and $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ as the driving force for reaction increases. The potential region where this occurs, $E<E^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$, is called the inverted region for the cathodic process. For the anodic process, there is no inversion: $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$ is steadily larger, and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ is steadily smaller through Cases $\mathrm{N} 1-\mathrm{N} 3$.
- For Cases P1-P3 (dotted curves), we consider progressively more positive potentials vs. $E^{0^{\prime}}$. The behavior with respect to $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$ in this sequence is essentially the same as for $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ in Cases $\mathrm{N} 1-\mathrm{N} 3$. From Case 0 through Case P2, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$ declines. In the latter instance, the potential is $E^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$, and the intersection of the $\mathrm{O}+e$ and R curves lies exactly at the minimum of the R curve, where $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}=0$. At any more positive potential, including Case P3, the system operates

Figure 3.5.10 Curves representing the intersection of free-energy surfaces for $\mathrm{O}+e$ and R in the outer-sphere electrode reaction $\mathrm{O}+e \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$. The broad gray curve, having a minimum at $q_{\mathrm{R}^{\prime}}$, represents R at all potentials. The other curves, all having minima at $q_{\mathrm{O}}$, represent $\mathrm{O}+e$ at different potentials (indicated at right). These curves, and their intersections with the $R$ curve, are labeled to facilitate discussion in the text. Work terms are ignored in this figure and the accompanying discussion. To preserve clarity, the curve splitting expected at each intersection is not depicted.

in the inverted region for the anodic process, where the intersection point is on the "back side" of the R curve $\left(q^{\ddagger}>q_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$. In this region, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{b}}^{\ddagger}$ becomes progressively larger at more extreme potentials. Thus, we see the same kind of trend reversal for the anodic process at $E>E^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$ that we saw for the cathodic process at $E<E^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$. For the cathodic process, there is no inversion in Cases P1-P3: $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ is steadily larger with increasing potential, maintaining normal behavior.

The essence of inversion is that activation energy increases (and the corresponding rate constant decreases) with increasing driving force for a reaction. Normal behavior is precisely opposite: Activation energy decreases with increasing driving force, and the rate constant grows.

There are two physical reasons for the effect of inversion:

- A large driving force implies that the products are required to accept the liberated energy very quickly in vibrational modes, and the probability for doing so declines as $-\Delta G^{0}$ exceeds $\lambda$ (Section 20.5.1).
- The inverted region always features an intersection on the "back side" of the curve for the reactant configuration, where the curve splitting resulting from electronic coupling causes the reactant minimum and the product minimum to lie on different surfaces (Figure 3.5.11). Consequently, an electron-transfer reaction always becomes nonadiabatic in an inverted region. The momentum of a reacting system along the $q$-axis must actually be reversed for reaction to occur in the inverted region. Since $\kappa_{\text {el }} \ll 1$, the inhibition of reaction rate should be much greater than one would expect from the reversed trend in activation energy alone.

Figure 3.5.11 Marcus free-energy curves in the cathodic inverted region ( $E<E^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$ ). The minimum energy configurations for $\mathrm{O}+e$ and for R lie on different surfaces, so the reduction is nonadiabatic. This situation applies to any reaction in an inverted region.

### (f) Effect of the Electrode Material

For heterogeneous electron transfer, the Marcus theory entails an implicit assumption that electrons react from a narrow range of states on the electrode corresponding to the Fermi energy (caption to Figure 3.5.4). All implications of the theory presented above rest on that idea. However, the electrode material can introduce some additional effects especially relevant to kinetic behavior in the inverted regions.

For example, inversion is expected to be unobservable for electron transfer at a metal electrode because of a mechanism that we have not yet recognized (43). Although the reaction rate at the Fermi energy is indeed predicted to show inversion at very negative overpotentials, there remains a continuum of occupied states in the metal below the Fermi energy, and they can transfer an electron to O without inversion. Any low-level vacancy created in the metal by such a transfer would be filled ultimately with an electron from the Fermi energy, with dissipation of the difference in energy as heat; thus, the overall energy change would be as expected from thermodynamics. A parallel argument holds for oxidations at metals, where unoccupied states are always available above the Fermi energy to receive the transferred electron.

Here we have our first indication that the electronic structure of the electrode can be important in the kinetics of an outer-sphere electrode reaction. In Sections 3.5.5 and 21.2, we will develop that idea much more fully.

Even though rate inversion is not expected for electron transfer at metals, the flattening of heterogeneous rate constants at high overpotential is still predicted by Marcus theory for such systems and has been observed experimentally (65,66, 93).

In principle, rate inversion can occur for heterogeneous electron transfer at nonmetallic electrodes, such as semiconductors (Chapter 20) or conducting polymers (Section 20.2.3), if the electronic structure of the electrode does not support the mechanism outlined above
for metals. Examples of rate inversion at nonmetallic electrodes have indeed been reported (95-100); however, experimental manifestations of inversion remain rare in heterogeneous electrochemistry.

### (g) Predictions for Homogeneous Reactions

The Marcus theory also describes the relationship between the homogeneous and heterogeneous kinetics for a given reactant. Consider the rate constant for the self-exchange reaction,

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{R} \xrightarrow{k_{\mathrm{ex}}} \mathrm{R}+\mathrm{O} \tag{3.5.49}
\end{equation*}
$$

in comparison with $k^{0}$ for the related electrode reaction, $\mathrm{O}+e \rightarrow \mathrm{R}$. One can determine $k_{\mathrm{ex}}$ by labeling O isotopically and measuring the rate at which the isotope appears in R , or sometimes by other methods, like ESR or NMR. A comparison of (3.5.27) and (3.5.28), where $a_{\mathrm{O}}=a_{1}=a_{2}=a$ and $R=d=2 a$, yields

$$
\begin{equation*}
\lambda_{\mathrm{el}}=\lambda_{\mathrm{ex}} / 2 \tag{3.5.50}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda_{\mathrm{el}}$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{ex}}$ are the values of $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$ for the electrode reaction and the self-exchange reaction, respectively. For self-exchange, $\Delta G^{0}=0$, so (3.5.21) gives $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\lambda_{\mathrm{ex}} / 4$, as long as $\lambda_{\mathrm{o}}$ dominates $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ in the reorganization energy. For the electrode reaction, $k^{0}$ corresponds to $E=E^{0}$, so (3.5.22) gives $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\lambda_{\mathrm{el}} / 4$, again with the condition that $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ is negligible. From (3.5.50), one can express $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ for the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in common terms, and one finds that $k_{\text {ex }}$ is related to $k^{0}$ by the expression

$$
\begin{equation*}
\left(k_{\mathrm{ex}} / A_{\mathrm{ex}}\right)^{1 / 2}=k^{0} / A_{\mathrm{el}} \tag{3.5.51}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A_{\mathrm{ex}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{el}}$ are the pre-exponential factors for the self-exchange and electrode reactions, respectively. ${ }^{31}$ Roughly, $A_{\text {el }}$ is expected to be $10^{4}-10^{5} \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$, while $A_{\text {ex }}$ is anticipated as $10^{11}-10^{12} \mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ (101).

The Marcus theory also predicts the existence of an inverted region for homogeneous electron transfer, where $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ increases with the thermodynamic driving force for the electron transfer, $\Delta G^{0}$. Curves like those in Figure 3.5.10 can be drawn for homogeneous reactions and can be analyzed essentially as presented above for that figure. When $\Delta G^{0}=-\lambda, \Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ is zero, and the forward rate constant is predicted to be at a maximum. For any $\Delta G^{0}$ less exothermic than this value, the forward reaction is in the normal region, where $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ decreases with increasing driving force, and the forward rate constant increases. However, if $\Delta G^{0}$ is more exothermic than $-\lambda$ (i.e., for very strongly driven reactions), the activation energy becomes steadily larger with increased driving force, and the rate constant becomes smaller. This is the inverted region for the forward reaction. Likewise, there is an inverted region for the backward reaction when $\Delta G^{0}$ is more endothermic than $+\lambda$. The existence of the inverted region accounts for the phenomenon of electrogenerated chemiluminescence (Section 20.5) and has also been clearly seen by other means for electron-transfer reactions in solution (102).

An inverted region should be observable for interfacial electron transfer at the boundary between immiscible electrolyte solutions, with an oxidant, O , in one phase, and a reductant, $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$, in the other $(103,104)$. Experimental studies bearing on this issue have been reported (105).

## 3.5.5 A Model Based on Distributions of Energy States

An alternative theoretical approach to heterogeneous kinetics is based on the overlap between electronic states of the electrode and those of the reactants in solution (47-49, 53, 106, 107).

[^20]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/ad488176-d7c4-4b33-9659-99f7e7b9d37c-43.jpg?height=616&width=887&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=199)
Figure 3.5.12 Relationships among electronic states at an interface between a metal electrode and a solution containing species O and R at equal concentrations. The vertical axis is electron energy, E , on the absolute scale. Indicated on the electrode side is a zone, $4 k T$ wide, centered on the Fermi energy, $\mathbf{E}_{F}$, where the probability of occupancy, $f(\mathbf{E})$, makes the transition from a value of nearly 1 below the zone to a value of virtually zero above (graph in shaded area at left). On the solution side, the state density distributions are shown for O and R . These are gaussians having the same shapes as the probability density functions, $W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathrm{E})$ and $W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathrm{E})$. The electron energy corresponding to the formal potential, $\mathrm{E}^{0^{\prime}}$, is $-3.8 \mathrm{eV} . \lambda=0.3 \mathrm{eV}$. The Fermi energy corresponds to an electrode potential of -250 mV vs. $E^{0^{\prime}}$. Filled states are denoted on both sides of the interface by dark shading. Filled electrode states overlap with (empty) O states, so reduction can proceed. Since the (filled) R states overlap only with filled electrode states, oxidation is blocked.

The concept is presented graphically in Figure 3.5.12, which will be discussed extensively in this section. This model is rooted in contributions from Gerischer $(106,107)$ and is particularly useful for treating electron transfer at semiconductor electrodes (Section 20.2), where the electronic structure of the electrode is important.

### (a) Gerischer Model

The main idea is that an electron transfer can take place from any occupied energy state that is matched in energy, $\mathbf{E}$, with an unoccupied receiving state. If the process is a reduction, the occupied state is on the electrode and the receiving state is on an electroreactant, O. Conversely for an oxidation, the occupied state is on species $R$ in solution, and the receiving state is on the electrode. In general, the eligible states extend over a range of energies, and the total rate is an integral of the rates at each energy.

On the electrode, the number of electronic states in the energy range between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{E}+d \mathbf{E}$ is given by $A \rho(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}$, where $A$ is the area exposed to the solution, and $\rho(\mathbf{E})$ is the density of states [having units of (area-energy) ${ }^{-1}$, such as $\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{eV}^{-1}$ ]. The total number of states in a broad energy range is, of course, the integral of $A \rho(\mathbf{E})$ over the range. If the electrode is a metal, the density of states is large and continuous, but if it is a semiconductor, there is a sizable energy range, called the band gap, where the density of states is very small. (See Section 20.1 for a discussion of the electronic properties of materials.)

Electrons fill states in the electrode from lower energies to higher ones until all electrons are accommodated. Any material has more states than are required for the electrons, so there are always empty states above the filled ones. If the temperature were to approach 0 K , the highest filled state would correspond to the Fermi energy (or the Fermi level), $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$, and all states above the Fermi energy would be empty. At any higher temperature, thermal energy elevates some of the
electrons into states above $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$ and creates vacancies below. The filling of the states at thermal equilibrium is described by the Fermi function, $f(\mathbf{E})$,

$$
\begin{equation*}
f(\mathbf{E})=\left\{1+\exp \left[\left(\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}\right) / k T\right]\right\}^{-1} \tag{3.5.52}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is the probability that a state of energy $\mathbf{E}$ is occupied by an electron. For energies much lower than the Fermi energy, the occupancy is virtually unity, and for energies much higher than the Fermi energy, the occupancy is practically zero (Figure 3.5.12). States within a few $k T$ of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$ have intermediate occupancy, graded from unity to zero as the energy rises through $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$, where the occupancy is 0.5 . This intermediate zone is shown in Figure 3.5.12 as a band $4 k T$ wide (about 100 meV at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

The number of electrons in the energy range between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{E}+d \mathbf{E}$ is the number of occupied states, $A N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}$, where $N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E})$ is the density function

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{\mathrm{occ}}(\mathbf{E})=f(\mathbf{E}) \rho(\mathbf{E}) \tag{3.5.53}
\end{equation*}
$$

Like $\rho(\mathbf{E}), N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E})$ has units of (area-energy) ${ }^{-1}$, typically $\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{eV}^{-1}$, while $f(\mathbf{E})$ is dimensionless. In a similar manner, we can define the density of unoccupied states as

$$
\begin{equation*}
N_{\text {unocc }}(\mathbf{E})=[1-f(\mathbf{E})] \rho(\mathbf{E}) \tag{3.5.54}
\end{equation*}
$$

As the potential is changed, the energy levels on the electrode move linearly, with the change being toward higher energies at more negative potentials, and vice versa. The Fermi energy tracks the potential in the same way (Section 2.2.5). On a metal electrode, these changes occur not by the filling or emptying of many additional states, but mostly by charging the metal, so that all states are shifted by the effect of potential (Section 2.2). While charging does involve a change in the total electron population on the metal, the change is a tiny fraction of the total (Section 2.2.2). Consequently, the same set of states exists near the Fermi energy at all potentials. For this reason, it is more appropriate to think of $\rho(\mathbf{E})$ as a consistent function of $\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$, nearly independent of the value of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$. Since $f(\mathbf{E})$ behaves in the same way, so do $N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E})$ and $N_{\text {unocc }}(\mathbf{E})$. The picture is more complicated at a semiconductor, as discussed in Sections 20.1 and 20.2.

States in solution are described by similar concepts, except that filled and empty states correspond to different chemical species, namely the two components of a redox couple, R and O , respectively. These states differ from those of the metal by being localized. The R and O species cannot communicate with the electrode without approaching it closely. Since R and O can exist in the solution inhomogeneously and our concern is with the mix of states near the electrode surface, it is better to express the density of states in terms of concentration, rather than total number. At any moment, the removable electrons on R species in solution in the vicinity of the electrode are distributed over an energy range according to a concentration density function, $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$, having units of (volume-energy) ${ }^{-1}$, such as $\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \mathrm{eV}^{-1}$. Thus, the number concentration of R species near the electrode in the range between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{E}+d \mathbf{E}$ is $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}$. Because this small element of the R population should be proportional to the overall surface concentration of $\mathrm{R}, C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)$, we can factor $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ in the following way:

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})=N_{\mathrm{A}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) \tag{3.5.55}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the Avogadro constant, and $W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ is a probability density function with units of (energy) ${ }^{-1}$. Since the integral of $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ over all energies must yield the total number concentration of all states, which is $N_{\mathrm{A}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)$, we see that $W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ is a normalized function

$$
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}=1 \tag{3.5.56}
\end{equation*}
$$

Similarly, the distribution of vacant states, represented by O species, is given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})=N_{\mathrm{A}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) \tag{3.5.57}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ is normalized, as indicated for its counterpart in (3.5.56). In Figure 3.5.12, the state distributions for O and R are depicted as gaussians for reasons that we will discover below.

Now let us consider the rate at which O is reduced from occupied states on the electrode in the energy range between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{E}+d \mathbf{E}$. This is only a part of the total rate of reduction, so we call it a local rate for energy $\mathbf{E}$. In a time interval $\Delta t$, electrons from occupied states on the electrode can make the transition to states on species O in the same energy range, and the rate of reduction is the number that succeed divided by $\Delta t$. This rate is the instantaneous rate if $\Delta t$ is short enough that

- The reduction does not appreciably alter the number of unoccupied states on the solution side.
- Individual O molecules do not appreciably change the energy of their unoccupied levels by internal vibrational and rotational motion.

Thus, $\Delta t$ is at or below the time scale of vibration. The local rate of reduction can be written as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Local rate }(\mathbf{E})=\frac{P_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E}) A N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}}{\Delta t} \tag{3.5.58}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A N_{\text {occ }}(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}$ is the number of electrons available for the transition and $P_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ is the probability of transition to an unoccupied state on O . It is intuitive that $P_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ is proportional to the density of receiving states, $D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$. Defining $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ as the proportionality function, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Local rate }(\mathbf{E})=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) A N_{\mathrm{occ}}(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}}{\Delta t} \tag{3.5.59}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ has units of volume-energy (e.g., $\mathrm{cm}^{3} \mathrm{eV}$ ). The total rate of reduction is the sum of the local rates in all infinitesimal energy ranges; thus, it is given by the integral

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Rate }=v \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) A N_{\mathrm{occ}}(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E} \tag{3.5.60}
\end{equation*}
$$

where we have expressed $\Delta t$ in terms of a frequency, $v=1 / \Delta t$. The limits on the integral cover all energies, but the integrand has a significant value only where there is overlap between occupied states on the electrode and states of O in the solution. In Figure 3.5.12, the relevant range is roughly -4.0 to -3.5 eV .

Substitution from (3.5.53) and (3.5.57) gives

$$
\begin{equation*}
\text { Rate }=v A N_{\mathrm{A}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, \mathrm{t}) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) f(\mathbf{E}) \rho(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E} \tag{3.5.61}
\end{equation*}
$$

This rate is expressed in molecules or electrons per second. Division by $A N_{\mathrm{A}}$ gives the rate more conventionally in $\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, and further division by $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$ provides the rate constant,

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{f}}=v \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) f(\mathbf{E}) \rho(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E} \tag{3.5.62}
\end{equation*}
$$

In an analogous way, one can easily derive the rate constant for the oxidation of $R$. On the electrode side, the empty states are candidates to receive an electron; hence, $N_{\text {unocc }}(\mathbf{E})$ is the distribution of interest. The density of filled states on the solution side is $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$, and the probability
for electron transfer in the time interval $\Delta t$ is $P_{\mathrm{ox}}(\mathbf{E})=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$. Proceeding exactly as in the derivation of (3.5.62), we arrive at

$$
\begin{equation*}
k_{\mathrm{b}}=v \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}}(\mathbf{E}) W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})[1-f(\mathbf{E})] \rho(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E} \tag{3.5.63}
\end{equation*}
$$

In Figure 3.5.12, the distribution of states for species R does not overlap the zone of unoccupied states on the electrode, so the integrand in (3.5.63) is practically zero everywhere, and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ is negligible compared to $k_{\mathrm{f}}$. The electrode is in a reducing condition with respect to the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ couple. By changing the electrode potential to a more positive value, we shift the position of the Fermi energy downward, and we can reach a position where the R states begin to overlap unoccupied electrode states, so that the integral in (3.5.63) becomes significant, and $k_{\mathrm{b}}$ is enhanced.

The literature contains many versions of equations 3.5.62 and 3.5.63 manifesting different notation and involving wide variations in the interpretation applied to the integral prefactors and the proportionality functions, $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ and $\varepsilon_{\text {ox }}(\mathbf{E})$. For example, it is common to see a tunneling probability, $\kappa_{\mathrm{el}}$, or a precursor equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{R}}$, extracted from the $\varepsilon$-functions and placed in the integral prefactor. Often, the frequency $v$ is identified with $v_{\mathrm{n}}$ in (3.5.13). Sometimes, the prefactor encompasses things other than the frequency parameter, but is still expressed as a single symbol. The treatment offered here is general and can be accommodated to most views about how the fundamental properties of the system determine $\nu, \varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$, and $\varepsilon_{\text {ox }}(\mathbf{E})$.

With (3.5.62) and (3.5.63), it is apparently possible to account for kinetic effects of the electronic structure of the electrode by using an appropriate density of states, $\rho(\mathbf{E})$, for the electrode material. Efforts in that direction have been reported. However, one must be on guard for the possibility that $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ and $\varepsilon_{\text {ox }}(\mathbf{E})$ also depend on $\rho(\mathbf{E}) .^{32}$

### (b) Marcus-Gerischer Kinetics

To define the probability densities $W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ and $W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$, the Marcus theory can be added into the Gerischer model. The key is to recognize that the derivation leading to (3.5.21) is based implicitly on the idea that electron transfer occurs entirely from the Fermi energy. In the context that we are now considering, the local rate at the Fermi energy must, therefore, be proportional to the activation energy given by Marcus theory. We can rewrite (3.5.21) in terms of electron energy as ${ }^{33}$

$$
\begin{equation*}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}=\frac{\lambda}{4}\left(1-\frac{\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}}{\lambda}\right)^{2} \tag{3.5.64}
\end{equation*}
$$

32 Consider, for example, a simple model based on the idea that, in the time interval $\Delta t$, all electrons in the energy range between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{E}+d \mathbf{E}$ redistribute themselves among all available states with equal probability. A refinement allows for the possibility that the states on species O participate with different weight from those on the electrode. If the states on the electrode are given unit weight and those in solution are given weight $\kappa_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$, then

$$
P_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E})=\frac{\kappa_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) \delta}{\rho(\mathbf{E})+\kappa_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) \delta}=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) .
$$

where $\delta$ is the average distance across which electron transfer occurs, and $\kappa_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ is dimensionless and can be identified with the tunneling probability, $\kappa_{\text {el }}$, used in other representations of $k_{\mathrm{f}}$. If the electrode is a metal, $\rho(\mathbf{E})$ is orders of magnitude greater than $\kappa_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) \delta$; hence, the rate constant becomes

$$
k_{f}=v \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \kappa_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) \delta W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) f(\mathbf{E}) d \mathbf{E}
$$

which has no dependence on the electronic structure of the electrode.
33 A difference in potential, $\Delta E$, corresponds to a difference in electron energy $-\Delta \mathbf{E}$ (Section 2.2.5); therefore, $E-E^{0^{\prime}}$ corresponds to $-\left(\boldsymbol{E}-\boldsymbol{E}^{0^{\prime}}\right)$, and $E=E^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$ corresponds to $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$.
where $\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}$ is the energy corresponding to the formal potential of the $\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{R}$ couple. From the discussion in Section 3.5.4(e), one can understand that $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{\ddagger}$ reaches a minimum of zero at $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$. Thus, the maximum local rate of reduction at the Fermi energy is found where $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}=\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$. When the Fermi energy is at any other energy, $\mathbf{E}$, the local rate of reduction at the Fermi energy can be expressed, according to (3.5.13), (3.5.59), and (3.5.64), in terms of the following ratios

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text { Local rate }\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}=\mathbf{E}\right)}{\text { Local rate }\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}=\mathbf{E}^{0}+\lambda\right)} & =\frac{v_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}} \exp \left[-\frac{\lambda}{4 k T}\left(1-\frac{\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}}{\lambda}\right)^{2}\right]}{v_{n} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}}} \\
& =\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}(\mathbf{E}) D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) f\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}\right) \rho\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}\right)}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{red}}\left(\mathbf{E}^{0}+\lambda\right) D_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\lambda, \mathbf{E}^{0}+\lambda\right) f\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}\right) \rho\left(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}\right)} \tag{3.5.65}
\end{align*}
$$

Assuming that $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}$ does not depend on the position of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$, we can simplify this to

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})}{D_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\lambda, \mathbf{E}^{0}+\lambda\right)}=\exp \left[-\frac{\left(\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda\right)^{2}}{4 \lambda k T}\right] \tag{3.5.66}
\end{equation*}
$$

This is a gaussian distribution (Section A.3) having a mean at $\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda$ and a standard deviation of $(2 \lambda k T)^{1 / 2}$. From (3.5.57), $D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) / D_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\lambda, \mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda\right)=W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E}) / W_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\lambda, \mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda\right)$. Also, since $W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ is normalized, the exponential prefactor, $W_{\mathrm{O}}\left(\lambda, \mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda\right)$, is quickly identified (Section A.3) as $(2 \pi)^{-1 / 2}$ times the reciprocal of the standard deviation; therefore,

$$
\begin{equation*}
W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})=(4 \pi \lambda k T)^{-1 / 2} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda\right)^{2}}{4 \lambda k T}\right] \tag{3.5.67}
\end{equation*}
$$

In a similar manner, one can show that

$$
\begin{equation*}
W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})=(4 \pi \lambda k T)^{-1 / 2} \exp \left[-\frac{\left(\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}+\lambda\right)^{2}}{4 \lambda k T}\right] \tag{3.5.68}
\end{equation*}
$$

thus, the distribution for R has the same shape as that for O , but is centered on $\mathrm{E}^{0^{\prime}}-\lambda$, as depicted in Figure 3.5.12.

Any model of electrode kinetics is constrained by the requirement that

$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{k_{\mathrm{f}}}=e^{f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}=e^{-\left(\mathbf{E}-\mathbf{E}^{0^{\prime}}\right) / k T} \tag{3.5.69}
\end{equation*}
$$

which is easily derived from the need for convergence to the Nernst equation at equilibrium (Section 3.3.2). The development of the Gerischer model up through equations 3.5.62 and 3.5.63 is general, and one can imagine that the various component functions in those two equations might come together in different ways to fulfill this requirement. By later including results from the Marcus theory without work terms, we were able to define the distribution functions, $W_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ and $W_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$. In this Marcus-Gerischer model, (3.5.69) requires that $\varepsilon_{\text {red }}(\mathbf{E})$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{ox}}(\mathbf{E})$ be identical functions. However, this will not necessarily be true for related models including work terms.

### (c) Effect of Reorganization Energy

In the Marcus-Gerischer model, the reorganization energy, $\lambda$, has great influence on the predicted current-potential response. Figure 3.5.13a illustrates behavior for $\lambda=0.3 \mathrm{eV}$, a value near the lower limit found experimentally. For this reorganization energy, an overpotential of

Figure 3.5.13 Effect of $\lambda$ on kinetics in the Marcus-Gerischer representation. (a) $\lambda=0.3 \mathrm{eV}$. (b) $\lambda=1.5 \mathrm{eV}$. Species $O$ and $R$ are at equal concentrations, so the Fermi energy corresponding to the equilibrium potential, $\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{F}, \text { eq }}$, is the electron energy at the formal potential, $\mathrm{E}^{0^{\prime}}$. Fermi energy shifts with electrode potential: (1) $\eta=-300 \mathrm{mV}$, (2) $\eta=+300 \mathrm{mV}$, (3) $\eta=-1000 \mathrm{mV}$, and (4) $\eta=+1000 \mathrm{mV}$. In each case, the Fermi energy is the central line in the group, and the lighter lines mark $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}} \pm k T$. On the solution side: $D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathrm{E})$ is a dashed curve, $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathrm{E})$ is solid.

-300 mV (case 1) places the Fermi energy opposite the peak of the state distribution for O ; hence, rapid reduction would be seen. Likewise, an overpotential of +300 mV (case 2) brings the Fermi energy down to match the peak in the state distribution for R and enables rapid oxidation. An overpotential of -1000 mV (case 3) creates a situation in which $D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ overlaps entirely with filled states on the electrode, and for $\eta=+1000 \mathrm{mV}$ (case 4 ), $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$ overlaps only empty states on the electrode. These latter two cases correspond to very strongly enabled reduction and oxidation, respectively. ${ }^{34}$

Figure 3.5.13b shows the very different situation for the large reorganization energy of 1.5 eV . In this case, an overpotential of -300 mV is not enough to elevate the Fermi energy into a condition where filled states on the electrode overlap $D_{\mathrm{O}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$, nor is an overpotential of +300 mV enough to lower the Fermi energy into a condition where empty states on the electrode overlap $D_{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, \mathbf{E})$. It takes $\eta \approx-1000 \mathrm{mV}$ to enable reduction significantly, and $\eta \approx+1000 \mathrm{mV}$ to do the same for oxidation. For this reorganization energy, the anodic and cathodic branches of the $i-E$ curve would be widely separated, as exemplified in Figure 3.4.2c or Figure 3.5.7b.

Since this formulation of heterogeneous kinetics in terms of overlapping state distributions is linked directly to the basic Marcus theory, it is not surprising that many of its predictions are compatible with those of the Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4. The principal difference is that this formulation allows explicitly for contributions from states far from the Fermi energy, which can be important in reactions at semiconductor electrodes (Section 20.2) or involving bound monolayers on metals (Section 17.6.2). Work confirming the existence of inversion in heterogeneous reactions at semiconductor electrodes relied on the Marcus-Gerischer formulation for interpretation (95-99).
