In Chapter 1, we established a proportionality between the current and the net rate of an electrode reaction. We also recognized that for a given electrode process, current does not flow in some potential regions; yet, it flows to a varying degree in others. The reaction rate is, therefore, a strong function of potential.

In this chapter, our goal is to devise a theory that can quantitatively rationalize the observed behavior of electrode kinetics with respect to potential and concentration. Once constructed, the theory will support our understanding of kinetic effects in new situations. We begin with a brief review of certain aspects of homogeneous kinetics, which offer both a familiar starting ground and a basis for the construction, through analogy, of an electrochemical kinetic theory.

    7 The standard rate constant is also designated by $k_{\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{h}}$ or $k_{\mathrm{s}}$ in the electrochemical literature. Sometimes, it is also called the intrinsic rate constant.
    8 Nor did we invoke the Nernst equation. We only made use of $E^{0^{\prime}}$ as an identifier for the equilibrium potential of the special case. It remains for us to demonstrate that this theory will predict a nernstian balance at equilibrium (Section 3.4.1).

[^6]:    10 Sometimes $\alpha$ for a one-step, one-electron reaction is called the symmetry factor, and sometimes it is symbolized by $\beta$ (7). However, the use of the symbol $\alpha$ and the name transfer coefficient for the concept identified in this section are much more commonly found in the literature.

[^7]:    12 Since double-layer effects have not been included in this treatment, $k^{0}$ and $i_{0}$ are, in Delahay's nomenclature (16), apparent constants of the system. Both depend on double-layer structure to some extent and are functions of the potential at the outer Helmholtz plane, $\phi_{2}$, relative to the solution bulk. This point will be discussed in more detail in Section 14.7.

[^8]:    13 For $\alpha=0.5,-b=0.118 \mathrm{~V}$ per decade of current, a value that is sometimes quoted as a "typical" Tafel slope.
    14 The same criterion is reached by considering the anodic branch.

[^9]:    15 Even if there is not a strong interaction with the electrode, the kinetics of an outer-sphere reaction can depend on the electrode material, because of (a) double-layer effects (Section 14.7), (b) the effect of the metal on the structure of the Helmholtz layer, or (c) the effect of the energy and distribution of electronic states in the electrode (Section 3.5.5).

[^10]:    16 But not so strong as to produce chemical binding. The discussion here is about outer-sphere electrode reactions, so the electroreactant is outside the solvent layer at the electrode surface.

[^11]:    17 The presentation below is based on the theory founded by Marcus in 1956, then elaborated by Marcus and others over later decades, to describe thermally activated electron-transfer reactions (citations above). An important contributor was Hush, who gave early attention to electrode reactions. The overall body of work is often also called the Marcus-Hush theory.

[^12]:    18 In the precursor state, species O is positioned, on a molecular scale, in the proper relationship to the electrode for reaction (at the right distance, perhaps in a favored orientation). The symbol $\Gamma_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {pre }}}$ quantifies the two-dimensional concentration of species O in this condition, which would be a subset of O molecules near the electrode and included in the three-dimensional concentration, $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$.

[^13]:    19 The pre-exponential term sometimes also includes a nuclear tunneling factor, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{n}}$, which is disregarded here. It arises from a quantum mechanical treatment that accounts for electron transfer for nuclear configurations with energies below that of the transition state $(50,56,80)$.
    20 But not chemical bonding. See Section 3.5.2(b).
    21 In the literature, the O configuration is sometimes called the precursor complex, while the R configuration is termed the successor complex. This language is appropriate if one consistently thinks of the O configuration as "the

[^14]:    reactant" and the R configuration as "the product." We are generally interested in reactions in both directions, so we use one name, precursor state, for the reactive assembly, while distinguishing the O and R configurations. 22 In the literature (and in the second edition of this book), one can find $\Delta G^{0}$ for an electrode reaction given as $F\left(E-E^{0}\right)$. Since the rate expressions are based on concentrations, it is more appropriate to use $F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$. Marcus himself employed the formal potential in his original work on heterogeneous kinetics (41). 23 The development of Marcus theory given here essentially implies that free energies are expressed in J/mol, as indicated in (3.5.14) and (3.5.15). This point is implicit in (3.5.13) and in the identification of $\Delta G^{0}$ as $F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$ for a heterogeneous reaction, since $F$ and $E$ are always expressed in $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}$ and V , respectively, the product $F\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)$ is in $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol}$.

[^15]:    24 This treatment does not include the effect of electronic coupling [Section 3.5.2(b)], which lowers the energy of the transition state by the amount $H_{\mathrm{ab}}$. This term can be easily added and would eventually manifest itself as a constant factor in the pre-exponential of the rate constant. We omit it here for simplicity. Nothing in the later discussion is appreciably affected by the omission.

[^16]:    25 The work terms are the standard free energy changes for the precursor equilibria; therefore, $w_{\mathrm{O}}=-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}}$ and $w_{\mathrm{R}}=-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{R}}$.
    26 One must not confuse the inner and outer components of $\lambda$ with the concepts of inner- and outer-sphere reaction. In the treatment under consideration, we are dealing with an outer-sphere reaction, and $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $\lambda_{0}$ simply apportion the reorganization energy between the main participants and the solvation sphere.
    27 In some treatments of electron transfer, the assumption is made that the reactant charge is largely shielded by counter ions in solution, so that an image charge does not form in the electrode. In that case, $R$ is the distance between the center of the reactant molecule and the electrode (26, 44).

[^17]:    28 The development of the Marcus theory often involves energies expressed in joules (footnote 23), but much analysis is based on energies expressed on a molecular basis. The most convenient energy unit for that purpose is the electron-volt ( eV ). One can convert an energy from $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol}$ to $\mathrm{eV} /$ molecule by dividing by both the Avogadro constant, $N_{\mathrm{A}}(\mathrm{molecule} / \mathrm{mol})$, and the charge on an electron, $e(\mathrm{C} /$ electron $)$. Since the product of the divisors, $N_{\mathrm{A}} e$, is the Faraday constant, the conversion factor is simply $F$. A single molecule or single electron often remains unexpressed in units, so energies meant as $\mathrm{eV} /$ molecule are usually just written and spoken as eV . For the same reason, $e$ and $F$ are normally given in C and $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}$, respectively, rather than $\mathrm{C} /$ electron C molecule $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ electron $^{-1}$.

[^18]:    29 This statement applies to a one-step, one-electron process. Tafel plots for complex mechanisms (Section 3.7 and Chapter 15) are often curved for other reasons (7).

[^19]:    30 A rollover in the rate constant at high overpotential is an important prediction of the Marcus theory, amplified carefully in the next paragraphs. However, the reader is cautioned that the effect is not expected to appear in all experimental situations. This point is discussed in Section 3.5.4(f), after the basic presentation of the effect.

[^20]:    31 With rate constants factored as in (3.5.13), $A_{\mathrm{ex}}=\left(K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} \nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}}\right)_{\text {hom }}$ and $A_{\mathrm{el}}=\left(K_{\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{O}} \nu_{\mathrm{n}} \kappa_{\mathrm{el}}\right)_{\text {het }}$, where the subscripts "hom" and "het" indicate that the factors apply to the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, respectively.

[^21]:    34. Cases 3 and 4 in Figure 3.5.13 illustrate the point made in Section 3.5.4(f) that an inverted region is not expected at a metal electrode. Electron transfer is not limited to the Fermi energy at a metal but, instead, can involve the continuum of states above and below the Fermi energy.
[^22]:    35 For this reaction in acidic bromide solution, the question was recently resolved (109) by electrochemical detection of Sn (III).
    36 In this book, inner-sphere and outer-sphere electrode reactions (Section 3.5.1) are frequently distinguished. In an outer-sphere process, the reactants, products, and intermediates do not interact chemically with the electrode surface. In an inner-sphere process, one or more participants do.
    37 Gileadi and Kirowa-Eisner (7) have suggested that this principle might not apply to the incorporation of an ion from solution into a metallic lattice (e.g., as with the two-electron reduction of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ on a copper electrode). The electrons required, though written stoichiometrically, might be viewed as just part of the conduction-band population, which adjusts to accommodate the deposited ion. In this respect, the electrodeposition of copper could be a quite different process than the reduction of, say, anthracene to the radical anion.

[^23]:    38 The discussions that follow hold if either or both of $n^{\prime}$ or $n^{\prime \prime}$ are zero.
    39 Regarding this point, let us offer a warning: In the first edition and in much of the older literature, one finds treatments of multielectron processes in which $n_{\mathrm{a}}$ is assumed to be the $n$-value of the rate-determining step. Consequently, $n_{\mathrm{a}}$ appears in many kinetic expressions. Since $n_{\mathrm{a}}$ is probably always 1 (if there is a rate-determining electron transfer), it is a redundant symbol and has been dropped here. The current-potential characteristic for a multistep process has often been expressed as

    $$
    i=n F A k^{0}\left[C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t) e^{-\alpha n_{a} f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}-C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t) e^{(1-\alpha) n_{a} f\left(E-E^{0^{\prime}}\right)}\right]
    $$

    This is rarely, if ever, a valid form of the $i-E$ characteristic for a multistep mechanism.
