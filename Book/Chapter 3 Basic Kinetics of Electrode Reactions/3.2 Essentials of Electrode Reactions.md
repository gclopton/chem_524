# 3.2 Essentials of Electrode Reactions

Any accurate kinetic picture of a dynamic process must yield an equation of the thermodynamic form in the limit of equilibrium. For an electrode reaction, equilibrium is characterized by the Nernst equation, which links the electrode potential to the bulk concentrations of the participants. For the simple case

$$
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{O}+n e \underset{k_{\mathrm{b}}}{\stackrel{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{R} \tag{3.2.1}
\end{equation*}
$$

this equation is

$$
\begin{equation*}
E_{\mathrm{eq}}=E^{0^{\prime}}+\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}}{C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}} \tag{3.2.2}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $E_{\text {eq }}$ is the equilibrium potential, $E^{0^{\prime}}$ is the formal potential (Section 2.1.7), and $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ and $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}$ are the bulk concentrations. Any valid theory of electrode kinetics must predict this result for corresponding conditions.

[^3]The theory must also explain the observed dependence of the current on potential under various circumstances. Especially relevant is the case of low current and efficient stirring, where the current is entirely controlled by interfacial electron-transfer kinetics. Early studies of such systems showed that the current is often related exponentially to the overpotential, $\eta=E-E_{\mathrm{eq}}$. That is,

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=a^{\prime} e^{\eta / b^{\prime}} \tag{3.2.3}
\end{equation*}
$$

or, as given by Tafel in 1905 (6, 7),

$$
\begin{equation*}
\eta=a+b \log i \tag{3.2.4}
\end{equation*}
$$

A successful model of electrode kinetics must explain the frequent validity of (3.2.4), known as the Tafel equation.

Reaction 3.2.1 has forward and backward paths as shown. The forward component proceeds at a rate, $v_{f}$, which must be proportional to the concentration of O at the electrode surface (often different from the bulk concentration, $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ ). Since we express the concentration at distance $x$ from the surface and at time $t$ as $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x, t)$, the surface concentration is $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$. The rate constant, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$, links the forward reaction rate to $C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)$; thus,

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)=\frac{i_{\mathrm{c}}}{n F A} \tag{3.2.5}
\end{equation*}
$$

This equation also relates $v_{\mathrm{f}}$ to a cathodic current, $i_{\mathrm{c}}$, that crosses the interface as a consequence of the forward reaction. Likewise, we have for the backward reaction

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{b}}=k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)=\frac{i_{\mathrm{a}}}{n F A} \tag{3.2.6}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $i_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the corresponding anodic current. The net reaction rate is

$$
\begin{equation*}
v_{\mathrm{net}}=v_{\mathrm{f}}-v_{\mathrm{b}}=k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)-k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)=\frac{i_{\mathrm{c}}-i_{\mathrm{a}}}{n F A} \tag{3.2.7}
\end{equation*}
$$

and we have, overall:

$$
\begin{equation*}
i=i_{\mathrm{c}}-i_{\mathrm{a}}=n F A\left[k_{\mathrm{f}} C_{\mathrm{O}}(0, t)-k_{\mathrm{b}} C_{\mathrm{R}}(0, t)\right] \tag{3.2.8}
\end{equation*}
$$

The net current, $i$, is measurable in an external circuit. The component currents, $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $i_{\mathrm{a}}$, are not independently measurable, but have conceptual value.

Reaction velocities in heterogeneous systems refer to unit interfacial area; hence, they have units of $\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}$. Consequently, heterogeneous rate constants carry units of $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$ when the concentrations are expressed in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$.
