Class activity 02-27

(a) At an ITIES, the experimentally driven interfacial event is ion transfer rather than electron transfer. Writing the transfer of $\mathrm{ACh}^+$ from the aqueous phase (W) to the nitrobenzene phase (NB) as an overall electrochemical reaction (including phases) gives
$$
\mathrm{ACh}^+(\mathrm{W}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{ACh}^+(\mathrm{NB}).
$$
Here, a charged species crosses the W|NB interface. The current corresponds to a net interfacial transfer event and is therefore a faradaic (charge-transfer) process.



(b) For a single ionic species $j$ distributed between two phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$, equilibrium requires
$$
\bar{\mu}_j^\alpha=\bar{\mu}_j^\beta.
$$
For the ITIES transfer of $\mathrm{ACh}^+$ between the water phase (W) and the nitrobenzene phase (NB), the correlation is therefore
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{W}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{NB}}.
$$

The first-step expansion is to write $\bar{\mu}$ as a chemical part plus electrical (inner-potential) part, and then write the chemical potential in activity form
$$
\bar{\mu}_j^\alpha=\mu_j^\alpha+z_jF\phi^\alpha,
\qquad
\mu_j^\alpha=\mu_j^{\circ,\alpha}+RT\ln a_j^\alpha.
$$
Substute the activity form of $\mu_j^\alpha$ into the electrochemical-potential definition gives the expanded electrochemical potential in phase $\alpha$
$$
\bar{\mu}_j^\alpha
=
\mu_j^{\circ,\alpha}+RT\ln a_j^\alpha+z_jF\phi^\alpha.
$$

Applying this expansion to $\mathrm{ACh}^+$ in each phase gives
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{W}}
=
\mu_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\circ,\mathrm{W}}
+RT\ln a_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{W}}
+z_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}F\phi^{\mathrm{W}},
$$
and
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{NB}}
=
\mu_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\circ,\mathrm{NB}}
+RT\ln a_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}^{\mathrm{NB}}
+z_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}F\phi^{\mathrm{NB}}.
$$
Since $\mathrm{ACh}^+$ is monovalent, $z_{\mathrm{ACh}^+}=+1$.
