# 1.6f Cyclic Voltammetry and Cell Reversibility (February 16, 2026)

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a primary tool for diagnosing whether an electrode process is fast enough to behave Nernstian on the measurement time scale and whether coupled chemistry makes the overall system appear chemically irreversible. At the half-cell level, CV distinguishes interfacial electron-transfer limitations (a kinetic question at the interface) from follow-up chemical reactions (a kinetic question in the adjacent solution). At the full-cell level, the same bookkeeping ideas reappear as questions about how half-reactions combine into a net reaction, how the direction of electron flow is determined, and how the sign and magnitude of $E_{\text{cell}}$ relate to spontaneity through $\Delta G_r=-nF E_{\text{cell}}$.

## 1.6f.1 Electrochemical reversibility in cyclic voltammetry (qualitative)

> [!definition] Standard rate constant
> The ==standard rate constant== $k^{0}$ is the kinetic parameter (in electron-transfer rate laws) that sets the intrinsic speed of interfacial electron transfer under standard-state conditions; larger $k^{0}$ corresponds to faster interfacial kinetics.

> [!definition] electrochemical reversibility
> ==electrochemical reversibility== is the condition that the interfacial electron-transfer step is fast enough, relative to the experimental time scale, that the interface remains near equilibrium (Nernstian) during a potential scan.

> [!definition] quasi-reversible
> ==quasi-reversible== describes an intermediate regime in which the interfacial electron-transfer kinetics are neither fast enough to be effectively Nernstian nor slow enough to behave as a fully irreversible limit on the experimental time scale.

A process with sufficiently large $k^{0}$ behaves electrochemically reversible on the CV time scale: as $E$ is scanned, surface activities (or concentrations) adjust quickly enough that the interface stays close to equilibrium. When $k^{0}$ is smaller, additional driving force is needed to sustain the same net rate, so the current–potential response becomes shifted and distorted relative to the reversible shape. The classification “reversible vs. quasi-reversible vs. irreversible” is therefore not a permanent label for a redox couple; it depends on the time scale set by the experiment (most directly through scan rate $v=dE/dt$).

The black trace is labeled “reversible” and shows paired forward and reverse features consistent with rapid electron transfer on the scan time scale.

## 1.6f.2 Chemical reversibility and coupled reactions in CV

> [!definition] chemical reversibility
> ==chemical reversibility== is the condition that any coupled homogeneous chemistry (before, after, or concurrent with electron transfer) is fast enough, and sufficiently backward-capable, that the overall chemical system can return to its initial composition on the experimental time scale.

Even if electron transfer is fast (electrochemically reversible), a follow-up chemical reaction can remove products and suppress the reverse-scan signal. In that case, the CV appears chemically irreversible because the system cannot regenerate the original redox form within the time available for the reverse scan. A practical diagnostic is scan-rate dependence: changing $v=dE/dt$ changes how long the system spends in the potential window where the coupled chemistry can proceed.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: CV signature of a follow-up chemical step (EC behavior)
> 1. Sketch a cyclic voltammogram that shows a strong forward feature but a suppressed reverse feature because products are consumed by follow-up chemistry.
> 2. On the same axes, sketch how the reverse feature would change qualitatively if the scan rate were increased (no numbers needed).
> 3. Label axes and annotate which part of the trace is most sensitive to the coupled chemistry.

> [!figure] Figure 1.6f.2.1: Chemical irreversibility suppresses the reverse-scan signal

> The schematic plots current $i$ versus potential $E$ for two cases labeled “reversible” (black) and “chemically irreversible” (red). In the chemically irreversible case, the reverse-scan feature is reduced because a coupled chemical step removes (or transforms) the electro-generated product so it cannot be converted back during the return scan.

## 1.6f.3 A full electrochemical cell: half-reactions, $E_{\text{cell}}$, and spontaneity

To connect half-cell behavior to a full cell, consider a hydrogen electrode paired with an $\mathrm{AgCl}/\mathrm{Ag}$ electrode:
$$
\mathrm{Pt}\,|\,\mathrm{H}_2\,|\,\mathrm{H}^+ \;\;\|\;\; \mathrm{Cl}^-\,|\,\mathrm{AgCl}\,|\,\mathrm{Ag}.
$$
Under the standard-state conditions used for the tabulated potentials, this cell has a standard cell potential of $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ=0.222~\mathrm{V}$.

The half-reaction at the hydrogen electrode is
$$
2\mathrm{H}^{+}+2e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_2,
$$
and the half-reaction at the silver/silver chloride electrode (written in the reduction direction) is
$$
\mathrm{AgCl}(s)+e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^-.
$$
When the cell is operating spontaneously in the direction shown, one half-cell runs as an oxidation and the other as a reduction, with electrons flowing through the external circuit from anode to cathode.

> [!equation] Cell potential from half-cell potentials
> $$
> E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}
> $$

This equation fixes the sign convention used throughout the chapter: once you decide which electrode is acting as the cathode (reduction) and which is acting as the anode (oxidation) for the direction of operation, $E_{\text{cell}}$ is the cathode potential minus the anode potential.

> [!equation] Cell potential from reaction Gibbs free energy
> $$
> \Delta G_r = -nF E_{\text{cell}}
> $$

This equation says that, for a reversible cell operating in the direction the reaction is written, electrical work output ($nF E_{\text{cell}}$ per mole of reaction) equals the decrease in reaction Gibbs free energy. In particular, $E_{\text{cell}}>0$ corresponds to $\Delta G_r<0$ for the spontaneous (galvanic) direction under the chosen sign convention.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Hydrogen/AgCl cell bookkeeping
> 1. Draw a cell diagram for $\mathrm{Pt}\,|\,\mathrm{H}_2\,|\,\mathrm{H}^+ \;\|\; \mathrm{Cl}^-\,|\,\mathrm{AgCl}\,|\,\mathrm{Ag}$ and label anode/cathode for the spontaneous direction.
> 2. Indicate the direction of electron flow in the external circuit and write the net reaction in the spontaneous direction.
> 3. On a second diagram, indicate what changes when the current direction is reversed.

> [!figure] Figure 1.6f.3.1: Hydrogen/AgCl cell diagram, electron flow, and current reversal
> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-16 page 02.png]]
> The top sketch identifies the hydrogen electrode as the anode (oxidation) and the $\mathrm{AgCl}/\mathrm{Ag}$ electrode as the cathode (reduction) for the spontaneous (galvanic) direction, with electrons drawn flowing through the external circuit. The middle annotations apply $E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}$ to obtain $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ=0.222~\mathrm{V}$ at standard state and connect the sign of $E_{\text{cell}}$ to the sign of $\Delta G_r=-nF E_{\text{cell}}$. The bottom sketch redraws the cell under reversed current, showing the electrode roles and reaction direction interchanged.

> [!Questions] Questions: From half-cells to a full cell
> 1. For a given cell diagram, what procedure do you use to decide which half-reaction runs as oxidation and which runs as reduction for the spontaneous direction?
> 2. Under the convention $E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}$, what does the sign of $E_{\text{cell}}$ tell you about the sign of $\Delta G_r$?
> 3. When current is reversed, which parts of the bookkeeping change (anode/cathode labels, electron-flow direction, net reaction), and which definitions stay the same?

## 1.6f.4 Worked cell classification and current reversal

> [!definition] electrochemical cell reversibility
> ==electrochemical cell reversibility== is the ability of a full electrochemical cell to be driven in the reverse (non-spontaneous) direction by reversing the imposed current, so that products can be converted back into reactants under the experimental conditions.

In practice, “reversing a cell” is not only a matter of swapping signs in formulas. Reversal requires that the necessary reactant forms can be regenerated (chemical reversibility) and that the relevant electron-transfer steps can proceed at the imposed rate (electrochemical reversibility).

> [!figure] Figure 1.6f.4.1: Electrochemical cell reversibility and a second example cell
> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-16 page 03.png]]
> The sketch introduces electrochemical cell reversibility as the idea that reversing current drives the net chemistry backward (reactants become products and vice versa), provided the chemistry can actually regenerate the required forms. It also shows a separate example cell (Zn/$\mathrm{H}^+$) with half-reaction arrows and the net reaction $\mathrm{Zn}+2\mathrm{H}^+ \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_2$ in the spontaneous direction, and notes water splitting ($2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2+\mathrm{O}_2$) as an example of a forced (non-spontaneous) direction.

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Balancing half-reactions and predicting the effect of current reversal
> For the hydrogen/AgCl electrochemical cell in Figure 1.6f.3.1:
> 
> **Part A:** Write the anode and cathode half-reactions (identify oxidation vs. reduction) and combine them to obtain the net cell reaction in the spontaneous direction.
> 
> **Part B:** Using $E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}$ and $\Delta G_r=-nF E_{\text{cell}}$, state what the sign of $E_{\text{cell}}$ implies about the sign of $\Delta G_r$ for the spontaneous direction.
> 
> **Part C:** Describe what changes (qualitatively) if the direction of current is reversed.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** **Part A:** In the spontaneous direction, the $\mathrm{AgCl}/\mathrm{Ag}$ electrode functions as the cathode, where reduction occurs:
$$
\mathrm{AgCl}(s)+e^- \rightarrow \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^-.
$$
The hydrogen electrode functions as the anode, where oxidation occurs (reverse of the reduction form):
$$
\mathrm{H}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}^{+}+2e^-.
$$
Multiply the silver/silver chloride half-reaction by 2 to balance electrons and add:
$$
\begin{aligned}
2\mathrm{AgCl}(s)+2e^- &\rightarrow 2\mathrm{Ag}(s)+2\mathrm{Cl}^- \\
\mathrm{H}_2 &\rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}^{+}+2e^- \\
\hline
\mathrm{H}_2+2\mathrm{AgCl}(s) &\rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}^{+}+2\mathrm{Ag}(s)+2\mathrm{Cl}^-.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Part B:** For the spontaneous direction, the cell potential is positive, $E_{\text{cell}}>0$, so the reaction Gibbs free energy change is negative:
$$
\Delta G_r=-nF E_{\text{cell}}<0.
$$
This indicates a thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous) net reaction in the direction written.

**Part C:** Reversing the current forces the cell to operate in the non-spontaneous direction. The roles of the electrodes as anode and cathode interchange (oxidation and reduction swap locations), and the net chemical reaction is driven backward. Thermodynamically, this corresponds to forcing $\Delta G_r>0$ for the imposed direction; in practice, the external power supply must provide the work required to drive the reverse reaction against the cell’s natural tendency.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Full-cell bookkeeping
> **Lesson 1:** For a galvanic cell operating spontaneously, identify oxidation and reduction first; then balance electrons to combine half-reactions into a net reaction, and interpret spontaneity via $E_{\text{cell}}>0 \Leftrightarrow \Delta G_r<0$.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Reversing the current reverses the direction of the net chemical change and interchanges which electrode functions as anode vs. cathode.

> [!exercise] Exercise 2: Diagnosing electrochemical vs. chemical irreversibility from CV sketches
> Figures 1.6f.1.2 and 1.6f.2.1 each compare a “reversible” trace to an “irreversible” trace.
> 
> **Part A:** For each figure, identify which kind of limitation is being highlighted (slow interfacial electron transfer vs. coupled chemical follow-up). State one qualitative feature of the trace that supports your classification.
> 
> **Part B:** For the chemically irreversible case, predict how the reverse-scan feature would change if the scan rate were increased.
> 
> **Part C:** Explain why scan-rate dependence is a useful diagnostic for distinguishing chemical irreversibility from electrochemical irreversibility.

**Solution (Exercise 2).** **Part A:** Figure 1.6f.1.2 emphasizes electrochemical (interfacial-kinetic) irreversibility: the “irreversible” trace is shifted and its return feature is diminished because electron transfer is too slow to maintain near-equilibrium at the interface on the scan time scale. Figure 1.6f.2.1 emphasizes chemical irreversibility: even if electron transfer is fast, a coupled chemical step consumes the electro-generated product, so the reverse-scan signal is suppressed because there is less of the original redox form available to regenerate on the return sweep.

**Part B:** Increasing scan rate compresses the time available for the coupled chemistry to proceed at potentials where product is generated. With less time for consumption, more of the electro-generated form survives into the reverse scan, so the reverse-scan feature becomes larger (i.e., the response appears more reversible).

**Part C:** Both slow electron transfer and coupled chemistry can suppress the reverse-scan signal, but they respond differently to changes in time scale. A scan-rate change directly changes the time window for homogeneous follow-up reactions to proceed, so it can reveal whether loss of reversibility is dominated by chemical consumption/regeneration rather than by interfacial electron-transfer limitations.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Interpreting “irreversible” CV shapes
> **Lesson 1:** An “irreversible-looking” CV can arise from slow interfacial electron transfer (electrochemical irreversibility) or from coupled chemistry that removes products (chemical irreversibility); use time-scale diagnostics to separate the two.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Scan rate acts as a time-scale dial: increasing $v$ shortens the time available for coupled chemical steps, which can make chemically irreversible behavior look more reversible in a CV.
