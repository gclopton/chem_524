# 1.6c Diffusion Layers; Mass Transfer; Limiting Current (February 6, 2026)

When an electrode reaction consumes (or produces) a dissolved species, the concentration at the electrode surface generally differs from the bulk concentration. The resulting concentration gradient drives mass transport and can become the rate-limiting bottleneck that sets the observed current. This section introduces the ==diffusion-layer (film) approximation==, defines the ==diffusion-layer thickness== and the ==mass-transfer coefficient==, and connects transport-controlled ==flux== to a diffusion-limited (==limiting current==) plateau that appears in current–potential curves.

## 1.6c.1 Concentration profiles and flux at an electrode

> [!Questions] Questions: Flux and its connection to current
> 1. In this chapter’s coordinate convention, what does $x=0$ represent, and in what direction does $x$ increase?
> 2. Define **flux** $J$ and state its physical units.
> 3. State Fick’s first law for one-dimensional diffusion and explain what the minus sign means physically.
> 4. If a species is consumed at an electrode so that $C(x=0)<C^*$, what is the direction of the diffusive transport (toward the electrode or away from it), and how can that be read from the sign of the flux component $J_x$?
> 5. Explain how a molar flux at an electrode is converted into an electrical current, and identify what $n$, $F$, and $A$ represent in that conversion.

Consider a one-dimensional concentration profile $C(x,t)$ measured normal to a planar electrode surface, where $x=0$ denotes the electrode surface and $x>0$ extends into solution. If a species is consumed at the electrode, then the near-surface concentration decreases relative to the bulk and a concentration gradient develops.

> [!definition] flux
> The **flux** $J$ is the molar flow of a species per unit area per unit time. In one-dimensional transport normal to a plane, it is the quantity that relates a surface reaction rate to the spatial concentration gradient in solution.

Under diffusion, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient.

> [!equation] Fick’s first law (one-dimensional diffusion)
> $$
> J_x = -D\,\frac{dC}{dx}
> $$

This equation says that the diffusive flux component in the $+x$ direction (here denoted $J_x$) is proportional to the concentration gradient and points down-gradient. For an electrode at $x=0$ consuming a species (so that $C(x=0)<C^*$), the concentration typically increases with distance into solution ($dC/dx>0$), which makes $J_x<0$: the net diffusive transport is toward the electrode (in the $-x$ direction).

Because electrode reactions are driven by the supply of reactant *to the surface*, it is often convenient to work with the **flux toward the electrode**, defined by
$$
J \equiv -J_x,
$$
so that $J\ge 0$ corresponds to net transport from solution to the electrode.

The electrical current is the faradaic charge-transfer rate, which is proportional to the molar rate at which electrons are transferred. If a reaction transfers $n$ electrons per mole of reactant consumed, then the current density equals $nF$ times the molar flux of that reactant. For an electrode area $A$, this gives a flux–current relationship.

> [!equation] Flux–current relation (faradaic current as a reaction flux)
> $$
> i = nFA\,J
> $$

This equation says that a molar reaction flux at the interface can be converted into a measured electrical current by multiplying by the electron stoichiometric number $n$, Faraday’s constant $F$ (charge per mole of electrons), and the electrode area $A$. In this section, $i$ and $J$ are used as *magnitudes* (with direction/sign attached later via a chosen plotting convention).

## 1.6c.2 Diffusion-layer (film) approximation and mass-transfer coefficient

> [!Questions] Questions: Film approximation and the mass-transfer coefficient
> 1. Define the **diffusion-layer (film) approximation** and describe what feature of the true concentration profile it is replacing.
> 2. Define the **diffusion-layer thickness** $\delta$ and explain what it means physically (and what it does *not* mean).
> 3. Define the **mass-transfer coefficient** $m$ and state its units.
> 4. In the film model, what change to $D$ or $\delta$ would increase the limiting current, and why?
> 5. What assumptions are implicitly made when replacing a curved concentration profile by a linear drop across a single $\delta$?

Many steady-state and quasi-steady analyses replace the detailed concentration profile near the electrode by an approximate linear drop across an effective diffusion-layer thickness $\delta$.

> [!definition] diffusion-layer (film) approximation
> The **diffusion-layer (film) approximation** models the near-electrode concentration field by assuming that most of the concentration change occurs across a single effective thickness $\delta$, so the concentration gradient can be treated as approximately constant over that region.

In this approximation, the concentration gradient is estimated as
$$
\frac{dC}{dx}\approx \frac{C^{*}-C(x=0)}{\delta}.
$$
Substituting this into the $J=-J_x$ convention from above (so that $J$ is the magnitude of flux toward the electrode) gives a flux written as a difference between bulk and surface concentrations.

> [!definition] diffusion-layer thickness
> The **diffusion-layer thickness** $\delta$ is an effective thickness of the near-electrode region over which the solution concentration changes from its bulk value $C^{*}$ to its surface value $C(x=0)$ in the film approximation.

> [!equation] Diffusion-layer (film) approximation for flux
> $$
> J \approx D\,\frac{C^{*}-C(x=0)}{\delta}
> $$

This equation says that, under the film approximation, the diffusive supply rate to the electrode is set by (i) how fast the species diffuses ($D$) and (ii) how “thin” the diffusion layer is ($\delta$), multiplied by the driving difference between bulk and surface concentrations. It is a transport statement, not a kinetic one.

It is convenient to package $D/\delta$ into a single transport parameter.

> [!definition] mass-transfer coefficient
> The **mass-transfer coefficient** $m$ is defined (in the diffusion-layer approximation) by $m=D/\delta$, so that the diffusive flux can be written as $J\approx m\,[C^{*}-C(x=0)]$.

> [!equation] Mass-transfer coefficient definition (film approximation)
> $$
> m=\frac{D}{\delta}
> $$

This equation says that the film-model mass-transfer coefficient is a lumped transport parameter with units of velocity: it increases with diffusivity and decreases as the diffusion layer thickens.

With this definition, the flux becomes
$$
J\approx m\,[C^{*}-C(x=0)].
$$

## 1.6c.3 Limiting current and the diffusion-controlled plateau

> [!Questions] Questions: Limiting current as a transport plateau
> 1. Define **limiting current** and explain (in words) why it produces a plateau in an $i$–$E$ curve.
> 2. For a reduction consuming $\mathrm{O}$, what does the condition $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\approx 0$ mean physically, and what regime does it correspond to?
> 3. List the three common modes of mass transport (diffusion, migration, convection) and describe one experimental change that would most strongly affect each one.
> 4. Explain why the limiting-current expression depends on transport conditions even when the electrode kinetics are “fast.”

For a reduction that consumes a dissolved oxidized form (call it $\mathrm{O}$), driving the potential sufficiently negative can make charge transfer fast compared to mass transport. In that regime, the surface concentration of the consumed species approaches zero, $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\approx 0$, because any $\mathrm{O}$ that arrives is immediately reduced. The flux then approaches a maximum transport-limited value
$$
J_{\mathrm{lim}}\approx m_{\mathrm{O}}\,C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}.
$$
The corresponding current is the (cathodic) diffusion-limited current.

> [!definition] limiting current
> The **limiting current** $i_{\mathrm{L}}$ is the plateau current reached when mass transport limits the supply (or removal) of a reacting species at the electrode, so that further changes in potential do not increase the faradaic current.

> [!equation] Limiting current under diffusion control (film approximation)
> $$
> i_{\mathrm{L}} = nFA\,m\,C^{*}
> $$

This equation says that, once the surface concentration of the consumed species is driven low enough that transport sets the supply rate, the current is fixed by the bulk concentration $C^*$ and the mass-transfer coefficient $m$ (with $m=D/\delta$ in the film picture). The symbol $i_{\mathrm{L}}$ is a plateau magnitude; the sign of the observed plateau on an $i$–$E$ plot depends on the plotting convention.

The limiting-current expression is not a statement about electrode kinetics; it is a statement about supply. It is therefore sensitive to the transport mode. In more complete descriptions, $m$ depends on whether transport is dominated by diffusion, migration, convection, or some combination, and on the hydrodynamic/geometry conditions that set $\delta$.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Two-step picture of mass-transfer-limited current
> 1. Draw a schematic “two-step” pathway for an electrode reaction $\mathrm{O}+ne^-\rightarrow \mathrm{R}$ in which (A) reactant is supplied to the interface by mass transport and (B) electrons are transferred at the interface.
> 2. Indicate on your schematic which step becomes rate-limiting in the mass-transfer-limited regime and what physical bottleneck that corresponds to.
> 3. Add a simple $i$–$E$ sketch showing how a transport-limited plateau would appear as potential is pushed to more strongly drive reduction.

> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-06 Figure 2 mass-transport-limited current steps.png|500]]
> The figure separates an electrode reaction into two coupled steps: (A) **mass transport** of reactant through solution (via diffusion, migration, and/or convection) to the interface and (B) **charge transfer** (electron transfer) at the interface converting $\mathrm{O}\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$.
> 
> When step (B) is fast compared to step (A), the overall rate is set by the supply of reactant to the surface, which produces a transport-controlled plateau current (a limiting current) as potential is driven further.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Steady-state $i$–$E$ curve with a diffusion-limited plateau
> 1. Sketch a steady-state voltammogram ($i$ vs. $E$) for a single reduction wave that approaches a diffusion-limited plateau.
> 2. Mark three potentials $E_1<E_2<E_3$ along the wave and label the corresponding currents $i_1<i_2<i_3$ (with $i_3$ near the plateau).
> 3. On your sketch, indicate which region is sensitive to electrode kinetics and which region is dominated by mass transport.

> The blue curve sketches a steady-state current–potential response in which current increases as potential is driven to favor reduction and then saturates at a diffusion-limited plateau (the limiting current).
> 
> The marked potentials $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$ correspond to increasing currents $i_1<i_2<i_3$, with $E_3$ lying in the plateau region where further potential change does not increase the reaction rate because mass transport controls the supply of reactant.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Concentration profile changes as potential drives diffusion limitation
> 1. Sketch $C(x)$ vs. $x$ for an electroactive species near a planar electrode at $x=0$ at several increasingly “driving” potentials.
> 2. Show how the surface concentration $C(x=0)$ decreases as the potential is pushed into the diffusion-limited regime, and indicate the limiting-case behavior.
> 3. Mark an effective diffusion-layer thickness $\delta$ and the bulk concentration $C^*$ on your sketch.

> [!figure] Figure 1.6c.4: Surface depletion and the diffusion-limited concentration gradient
> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-06 Figure 4 diffusion layer profiles at different potentials.png|500]]
> The sketches show concentration profiles $C(x)$ normal to an electrode ($x=0$) for different applied potentials: as the potential is driven to favor consumption of the reactant at the surface, the near-surface concentration drops while the bulk concentration $C^*$ remains unchanged on the time scale of the steady-state approximation.
> 
> In the diffusion-limited regime, $C(x=0)$ approaches zero and the concentration drop occurs primarily across an effective diffusion layer of thickness $\delta$, producing the maximum sustainable diffusive flux (and thus the limiting current).

## 1.6c.4 Surface composition from the Nernst equation (worked example)

> [!Questions] Questions: Nernst equation and surface composition
> 1. State the Nernst equation for a reversible $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$ couple and explain what composition ratio it depends on.
> 2. In voltammetry, why does the Nernst relation use **surface** concentrations (or activities) rather than bulk values?
> 3. If the Nernst equation determines only a ratio of surface concentrations, what additional independent constraint is commonly used to find the individual values?

The Nernst equation connects electrode potential to the ratio of reduced and oxidized forms at the electrode surface when the interfacial redox couple is at equilibrium. In concentration form at $T\approx 298\ \mathrm{K}$ (so that $2.303RT/F\approx 0.059\ \mathrm{V}$), it is commonly written as a base-10 logarithm.

> [!equation] Nernst equation (base-10 concentration form, 298 K)
> $$
> E = E^{0} - \frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right)
> $$

This equation says that, at interfacial equilibrium, the electrode potential is set by a standard term $E^{0}$ plus a logarithmic dependence on the **surface** composition ratio of reduced to oxidized forms. It is therefore a bridge between measured potential and the interfacial concentrations that are simultaneously shaped by transport and reaction.

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Surface composition from a Nernst ratio
> Consider a one-electron couple $\mathrm{O}+e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ at $T\approx 298\ \mathrm{K}$, so that the concentration-form Nernst equation can be written as
> $$
> E = E^{0} - 0.059\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right).
> $$
> Assume that at a particular time the total near-surface concentration is conserved so that
> $$
> C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)+C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=C^{*},
> $$
> with $C^{*}=1\ \mathrm{mM}$.
> 
> If the electrode is poised at $E=E^{0}-0.12\ \mathrm{V}$, determine (i) the ratio $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)/C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ and (ii) the individual surface concentrations $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)$ and $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** Substitute $E=E^{0}-0.12\ \mathrm{V}$ into the Nernst equation:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E^{0}-0.12
&=E^{0}-0.059\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right) \\
0.12
&=0.059\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
Divide by $0.059$ and exponentiate:
$$
\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right)=\frac{0.12}{0.059}\approx 2.03
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\approx 10^{2.03}\approx 1.08\times 10^{2}.
$$
Thus $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)\approx 108\,C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$. Using conservation of total concentration,
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)+C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)
&\approx 108\,C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)+C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \\
&=109\,C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0) \\
&=C^{*},
\end{aligned}
$$
so
$$
C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\approx \frac{C^{*}}{109}=\frac{1\ \mathrm{mM}}{109},
$$
and
$$
C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)\approx C^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=\frac{108}{109}\,(1\ \mathrm{mM}).
$$

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Limiting current and Nernst ratios
> **Lesson 1:** A diffusion-limited current plateau reflects a transport bottleneck (through $m=D/\delta$), not a loss of electron-transfer “driving force.”
> 
> **Lesson 2:** When a Nernst relation fixes a ratio (e.g., $C_{\mathrm{R}}/C_{\mathrm{O}}$), a second independent constraint (often mass conservation or a transport relation) is needed to determine the individual surface concentrations.
