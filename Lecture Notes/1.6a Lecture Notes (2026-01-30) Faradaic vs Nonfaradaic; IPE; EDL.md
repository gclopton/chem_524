# 1.6a Faradaic vs. Non-faradaic Interfacial Processes; the Ideally Polarizable Electrode; the Electric Double Layer (January 30, 2026)

Electrochemical current can arise in two qualitatively different ways. In a **faradaic** process, charge crosses the electrode/solution interface by an oxidation–reduction reaction, and the measured charge is directly tied to chemical change. In a **non-faradaic** process, no net interfacial charge-transfer reaction occurs; nevertheless, current can still be observed because the interface stores charge and reorganizes its structure in response to changes in potential. This section develops the basic language for these two regimes, explains how sign conventions affect the reading of $i$–$E$ curves, and introduces the capacitor model and the electric double layer used to describe charging of a metal/electrolyte interface.

## 1.6a.1 Faradaic processes and Faraday’s law


> [!Questions] Questions: Faradaic processes and Faraday’s law
> 1. Define **faradaic process**.
> 2. Write Faraday’s law relating the passed charge $Q$ to the moles of electrons transferred, and define every symbol you use.
> 3. A constant current $I$ flows for a time $t$. Write an expression for the passed charge $Q$, then state how you would use your result from Question 2 to compute the moles of electrons transferred.


> [!definition] Faradaic process
> A **faradaic process** is an interfacial process in which charge transfer occurs across the electrode/solution interface, i.e., an oxidation–reduction (electron-transfer) reaction proceeds and produces a chemical change that is quantitatively tied to the charge passed.

For a faradaic process, the experimental question “how much reaction happened?” is answered by counting electrons. If a total charge $Q$ passes through the external circuit, then the number of moles of electrons transferred is $Q/F$, and the corresponding particle count is obtained by multiplying by Avogadro’s number.

> [!equation] Faraday’s law (electrons from charge)
> $$
> n(e^-)=\frac{Q}{F}
> $$
> 
> $$
> N(e^-)=n(e^-)\,N_{\mathrm{A}}
> $$

These equations say that the extent of an electron-transfer reaction can be computed directly from the passed charge: dividing by Faraday’s constant converts charge (C) into moles of electrons, and multiplying by $N_{\mathrm{A}}$ converts moles into a particle count.

It is often convenient to relate charge to a measured current. If a constant current $I$ flows for a time $t$, the passed charge is $Q=It$.

> [!equation] Charge passed by a constant current
> $$
> Q = I t
> $$

This equation says that charge is the time integral of current; for a constant current, that integral reduces to the simple product $It$.

## 1.6a.2 Non-faradaic processes and charging current


> [!Questions] Questions: Non-faradaic processes and charging current
> 1. Define **non-faradaic process**.
> 2. What diagnostic question distinguishes a faradaic from a non-faradaic response (in terms of what must happen for charge to cross the interface)?
> 3. In a non-faradaic window, what physical process gives rise to the measured current, and what is the standard name given to that current in this chapter?


> [!definition] Non-faradaic process
> A **non-faradaic process** occurs at potentials where no net charge transfer reaction occurs because the relevant interfacial reaction is thermodynamically or kinetically unfavorable. In this case, the observed current is associated with **charging current** (also called **capacitive current**).

The key diagnostic question is: what would have to happen, chemically, for charge to cross the interface? If the only available charge-transfer reaction is inaccessible on the time scale of the experiment (for thermodynamic or kinetic reasons), then a sustained faradaic current cannot flow. The electrode can still exchange charge with the external circuit, but that charge accumulates at the interface and reorganizes the nearby solution; the measured current is then a charging (capacitive) current rather than a reaction current.




> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Faradaic vs. non-faradaic classification
> **Lesson 1:** A sustained current requires a sustained mechanism for charge to cross the interface; if no redox pathway is accessible, currents are transient and associated with charging of the interface, and the process is non-faradaic.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Non-faradaic (capacitive) currents track how the potential is driven in time, while faradaic currents track reaction/transport constraints and are tied to chemical change.


## 1.6a.3 Reading $i$–$E$ curves: axis and sign conventions


> [!Questions] Questions: Reading $i$–$E$ curves (sign and axis conventions)
> 1. State the two common $i$–$E$ plot conventions described in this section (current sign and which direction corresponds to more negative/more positive potential).



Because $i$–$E$ curves are used to infer what reactions occur at what potentials, the plotting convention must be established before any interpretation is attempted. Two conventions are common in electrochemistry, and both appear in the literature.

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Reading $i$–$E$ conventions
> State two common sign/axis conventions used in current–potential plots, and indicate (i) the sign of reduction vs. oxidation current and (ii) which direction on the potential axis corresponds to more negative or more positive potential.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** In one common convention, reduction (cathodic) current is defined as positive, and potentials are plotted so that moving to the right corresponds to more negative potential. Under this choice, cathodic processes appear on the “right-hand” (more negative) side of the plot with positive current.

In a second common convention, potentials increase to the right (more positive potential is plotted to the right), and anodic current is defined as positive. Under this choice, oxidation processes appear as positive current at more positive potentials.



> [!convention] Convention #1: $i$–$E$ plot (reduction current positive; negative potentials to the right)
> Cathodic (Oxidation) current is positive.
> 
> More negative potential is plotted to the right.
>
> _Note: This is the convention we use in this book._


> [!convention] Convention #2: $i$–$E$ plot (anodic current positive; positive potentials to the right)
> 
> Anodic (Reduction) current is positive.
> 
> More positive potential is plotted to the right.
> 




> [!draw-it] i-E plot
> 1. Using the i–E plotting convention in which cathodic (reduction) current is positive, sketch a labeled i–E plot. On your axes, include an arrow showing the direction of increasingly negative potential, and an arrow showing the direction of cathodic current.
>     
> 2. On the same axes, sketch a generic qualitative i–E response for a working electrode in an electrolyte with a finite electrochemical stability window. Indicate (and label) the potential interval over which the response is non-faradaic (dominantly capacitive), and mark the approximate potential boundaries where faradaic current becomes significant.
>     
> 3. Redraw the same physical behavior using the plotting convention in which anodic current is positive. Again, include arrows showing the direction of increasingly positive potential and anodic current, and label the stability window boundaries.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Conventions in electrochemical plots
> **Lesson 1:** Always identify the sign convention before interpreting an $i$–$E$ curve; the same physical behavior can appear “flipped” if the potential axis direction or current sign definition changes.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** The labels “cathodic/anodic” and “reduction/oxidation” refer to reaction direction, but the plotted current sign depends on the chosen convention.

## 1.6a.4 Poised systems and Nernstian context


> [!Questions] Questions: Poised systems and Nernstian composition dependence
> 1. Define **poised system**.
> 2. For a reversible $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$ couple written $\mathrm{O}+ne^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$, write the Nernst equation given in this section.
> 3. At fixed $T$, if the activity ratio $a_{\mathrm{O}}/a_{\mathrm{R}}$ increases, does the equilibrium potential $E$ increase or decrease in the activity-form Nernst equation?
> 4. What experimental behavior (as described here) would indicate that a system is poised rather than drifting or history-dependent?


> [!definition] Poised system
> A system is **poised** when a reversible redox couple is present in both oxidized and reduced forms at sufficient concentration such that an inert electrode rapidly equilibrates to a Nernstian potential determined by the $\mathrm{Ox} /$ Red ratio (over the relevant time scale).

When both redox forms are present in the bulk, the interface can exchange electrons with a reservoir of oxidant and reductant, and the equilibrium potential depends on composition. In its simplest form for an $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$ couple written as $\mathrm{O}+ne^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$, the Nernst equation expresses this dependence through an activity ratio.

> [!equation] Nernst equation (activity ratio for $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$)
> $$
> E = E^{0} + \frac{RT}{nF}\ln\!\left(\frac{a_{\mathrm{O}}}{a_{\mathrm{R}}}\right)
> $$

This equation says that, at fixed temperature, the equilibrium potential shifts logarithmically with the oxidized-to-reduced activity ratio. The prefactor $(RT/nF)$ sets the “Nernst slope,” so changing $n$ changes how sensitive $E$ is to composition.

An important reference example (and a common laboratory reference half-cell) is the hydrogen couple at an inert Pt electrode. This connects directly to the idea of a poised system: if both $\mathrm{H}^+$ (in solution) and $\mathrm{H}_2$ (as a gas phase at controlled pressure) are present, the Pt electrode can rapidly equilibrate to a Nernstian potential set by the $\mathrm{H}^+/\mathrm{H}_2$ activities. Written in the reduction direction,

> [!equation] Hydrogen electrode half-reaction (written in reduction direction)
> $$
> 2\mathrm{H}^+ + 2e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_2
> $$

This equation says that the hydrogen couple interconverts protons in solution and hydrogen gas by transfer of two electrons; which way you write it (reduction vs. oxidation direction) is a bookkeeping choice that should match the convention being used for potentials and half-reactions in the surrounding discussion.

Written in the oxidation direction, this same half-reaction is
$$
\mathrm{H}_2 \rightleftharpoons 2\mathrm{H}^+ + 2e^-.
$$








> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Poised vs. unpoised systems
> **Lesson 1:** A half-cell is poised when a *reversible couple* is present in both forms in a way that acts as a reservoir on the experiment’s time scale; then the electrode potential is Nernstian (composition-controlled) rather than history-dependent.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** “Both forms present” can be supplied by solution species (e.g., $\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{R}$ both dissolved) or by coexisting phases at the electrode (e.g., a metal and a sparingly soluble salt), with the solution activity setting the equilibrium through the Nernst equation.





## 1.6a.5 The ideally polarizable electrode (IPE) and the capacitor model


> [!Questions] Questions: IPE and the capacitor model of interfacial charging
> 1. Define **ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)**.
> 2. In the IPE (blocked-interface) limit, what happens when the applied potential is changed, and why does that imply no net charge-transfer reaction occurs?
> 3. Write the capacitor relation connecting stored charge $q$, potential difference $E$, and capacitance $C$, and state what each symbol represents in the interfacial model.
> 4. Write the parallel-plate capacitance model in terms of $\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon_0$, $A$, and $d$, and state how changing $A$, $d$, or $\varepsilon$ changes $C$.
> 5. Starting from your capacitor relation and $i=dq/dt$ (with constant $C$), derive the expression for capacitive (charging) current in terms of $dE/dt$. Then state one qualitative prediction this makes for how charging current depends on scan rate in a linear potential ramp.


> [!definition] Ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)
> An **ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)** is an idealized electrode/solution interface across which charge cannot pass when a potential is applied; instead, charge accumulates on either side of the interface, and the interface behaves like a capacitor.

The IPE model is the limiting case of a “blocked” interface: changing the electrode potential does not drive a net electron-transfer reaction, so the interfacial region responds by storing charge. The simplest electrical model is a capacitor, for which the stored charge is proportional to the potential difference across the interface.


> [!exercise] Exercise 3: Modeling an IPE as a capacitor
> For the IPE Model
> 
> **Part A:** Write capacitor relation for interfacial charging.
> 
> **Part B:** Derive the parallel plate capacitance model.

**Solution (Exercise 3).** **Part A:** The defining relation for capacitance is $C=q/E$, so $q=CE$.

**Part B:** For parallel plates separated by a dielectric, the electric field magnitude in the gap is $\mathcal{E}=\sigma/(\varepsilon\varepsilon_0)$, where $\sigma=q/A$ is the surface charge density. The potential difference is $E=\mathcal{E}d$, so
$$
\begin{aligned}
C
&=\frac{q}{E} \\
&=\frac{\sigma A}{\left(\sigma/(\varepsilon\varepsilon_0)\right)d} \\
&=\varepsilon\varepsilon_0\,\frac{A}{d}.
\end{aligned}
$$

> [!equation] Capacitor relation for interfacial charging
> $$
> q = C\,E
> $$

This equation says that the interfacial charge stored is proportional to the interfacial potential difference, with the proportionality set by the capacitance $C$. In the IPE (blocked-interface) limit, this captures charge storage without net charge transfer across the interface.




> [!equation] Parallel-plate capacitance model
> $$
> C=\varepsilon\,\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{A}{d}
> $$

This equation says that the capacitance increases with effective area $A$ and permittivity $\varepsilon\varepsilon_0$ and decreases with effective separation $d$. In interfacial modeling it serves as a scaling guide for how geometry and dielectric response influence measured capacitance.

Once charge storage is admitted, the corresponding current is obtained by differentiating the stored charge with respect to time. This gives the fundamental link between charging current and time-dependent potential programs (steps, sweeps, and cycles).



> [!exercise] Exercise 4: Deriving capacitive (charging) current
> Starting from your capacitor relation and $i=dq/dt$ (with constant $C$), derive the expression for capacitive (charging) current in terms of $dE/dt$. Then state one qualitative prediction this makes for how charging current depends on scan rate in a linear potential ramp.



**Solution (Exercise 4).** Starting from the capacitor relation,
$$
q = C\,E,
$$
and assuming $C$ is constant in time, differentiate both sides with respect to time:
$$
\frac{dq}{dt}
= \frac{d}{dt}\!\left(C\,E\right)
= C\,\frac{dE}{dt}.
$$
Using the definition of current as the time rate of change of stored charge at the interface,
$$
i_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{dq}{dt},
$$
we obtain
$$
i_{\mathrm{C}} = C\,\frac{dE}{dt}.
$$

For a linear potential ramp, $E(t)$ is linear in $t$, so $dE/dt$ is a constant (the scan rate). Therefore the capacitive current is approximately constant during the ramp and scales linearly with scan rate: increasing the scan rate increases $|i_{\mathrm{C}}|$ in direct proportion (with the sign set by the direction of the ramp).

> [!equation] Capacitive (charging) current
> $$
> i_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{dq}{dt}=C\,\frac{dE}{dt}
> $$

This equation says that, when the interface behaves capacitively, the measured current is proportional to the scan rate (or more generally the time derivative of the applied potential). In particular, for constant $C$, a linear ramp produces an approximately constant charging current, while a potential step produces a transient charging current.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: IPE as a capacitor and geometric scaling of capacitance
> 1. Draw a simple capacitor-style model for a blocked electrode/electrolyte interface (ideally polarizable electrode), indicating opposite-sign charge accumulation on the metal side and in the adjacent solution.
> 2. Label the geometric parameters in the parallel-plate analogy (effective area $A$ and separation $d$) and indicate how changing each one qualitatively changes the capacitance $C$.



> [!figure]
> ![[Pasted image 20260228030605.png]]
> The upper sketch emphasizes a sign convention for $i$–$E$ plots (anodic current positive; $E$ increasing to the right) as a reminder that the interpretation of “positive current” depends on the chosen plotting convention.
> 
> The main diagram models an ==ideally polarizable electrode (IPE)== as a capacitor: applying a potential changes the interfacial charge distribution (double-layer charging) while net charge transfer across the interface is blocked. In the parallel-plate analogy, the effective capacitance scales as $C\propto \varepsilon\varepsilon_{0}(A/d)$, highlighting the roles of effective area, separation distance, and permittivity.
> 
> The sketch also indicates that, in the non-faradaic (blocked) limit, observed current under time-dependent potential programs is capacitive (charging) current rather than faradaic reaction current.







> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Non-faradaic (capacitive) current
> **Lesson 1:** When interfacial charge transfer is blocked, current can still flow because the interface stores charge; the resulting charging current depends on how quickly the interfacial potential is changed.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Any change in geometry or dielectric response (affecting $A$, $d$, or $\varepsilon$) changes the capacitance and therefore the amount of charge required to reach a given potential difference.

## 1.6a.6 The electric double layer: structure and charge bookkeeping


> [!Questions] Questions: Electric double layer structure and charge bookkeeping
> 1. Define the following terms:
>    a. **electric double layer**
>    b. **inner Helmholtz plane (IHP)**
>    c. **outer Helmholtz plane (OHP)**
> 2. Write the double-layer charge-density bookkeeping relationship among $\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}$, $\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}$, $\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}$, and $\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}$, and state what each superscript ($\mathrm{m}$, $\mathrm{S}$, $\mathrm{i}$, $\mathrm{d}$) refers to.
> 3. Interpret the sign convention in your relationship: if the metal is negatively charged, what must be true about the net solution-side charge density, and why?


> [!definition] Electric double layer
> The **electric double layer** is the interfacial region in which excess charge on the metal electrode is balanced by a structured distribution of charge in the electrolyte (and by oriented dipoles), so that the net interfacial charge is balanced overall even though charge is spatially separated into layers.

At a metal/electrolyte interface, excess electronic charge resides very near the metal surface, while compensating ionic charge and solvent orientation reside on the solution side. A common conceptual partition treats the solution-side charge distribution as having a compact **inner layer** (which can include **specifically adsorbed ions**) and a spatially extended **diffuse layer** associated with **non-specifically adsorbed ions** that respond primarily to long-range electrostatic forces. The drawing in Figure 1.6a.3 labels two idealized planes, $x_1$ and $x_2$, that mark the inner and outer boundaries of the compact region.

> [!definition] Inner Helmholtz plane (IHP)
> The **inner Helmholtz plane (IHP)** marks the effective plane of closest approach for specifically adsorbed ions (and the compact, inner-layer structure) at the interface.

> [!definition] Outer Helmholtz plane (OHP)
> The **outer Helmholtz plane (OHP)** marks the boundary between the compact (inner) layer and the start of the diffuse-layer charge distribution in the electrolyte.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Electric double layer structure and charge bookkeeping
> 1. Draw a metal/electrolyte interface and sketch an electric double layer that includes (i) specifically adsorbed ions near the surface, (ii) an inner (compact) layer, and (iii) a diffuse layer extending into bulk solution.
> 2. Label the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), and indicate which region lies between them and which region begins at the OHP.
> 3. Under your sketch, write the charge-density bookkeeping relationship that links the metal charge density, the total solution-side charge density, and its decomposition into inner-layer and diffuse-layer contributions (use the symbols $\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}$, $\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}$, $\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}$, and $\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}$).

> [!figure] Figure 1.6a.3: Metal/electrolyte electric double layer with IHP, OHP, and diffuse layer
> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-01-30 Figure 3 electric double layer schematic.png]]
> The left schematic depicts the ==electric double layer== at a metal/electrolyte interface, separating the solution-side structure into a compact inner region near the surface and a diffuse layer extending into bulk solution. Specifically adsorbed ions reside near the surface within the compact region; the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) marks the plane of closest approach for specifically adsorbed ions, while the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) marks the boundary between the compact region and the start of the diffuse layer.
> 
> The right sketch emphasizes charge bookkeeping: the metal carries an excess charge (often denoted $q^{\mathrm{m}}$), balanced by the total solution-side excess charge ($q^{\mathrm{S}}$). In charge-density form, the total solution-side charge density is decomposed into an inner-layer contribution and a diffuse-layer contribution, providing a convenient way to organize electrostatic neutrality across the interface.

Charge balance across the interface can be expressed either in terms of total charges ($q^{\mathrm{m}}$ on the metal and $q^{\mathrm{S}}$ on the solution side) or, more commonly, in terms of charge densities (charge per interfacial area). In the notation of Figure 1.6a.3, the solution-side charge density is decomposed into inner-layer and diffuse-layer parts and balances the metal-side charge density with opposite sign.

> [!equation] Double-layer charge-density bookkeeping (metal vs. solution)
> $$
> \sigma^{\mathrm{S}}=\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}+\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}=-\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}
> $$

This equation says that the total solution-side excess charge density equals the sum of inner-layer and diffuse-layer contributions, and that it balances the metal-side excess charge density with opposite sign (electrostatic neutrality of the interface as a whole).

Here the superscripts $m$, $S$, $i$, and $d$ refer to the metal electrode, total solution-side charge, inner-layer contribution, and diffuse-layer contribution, respectively.

> [!exercise] Exercise 5: Double-layer charge bookkeeping
> Using the definitions $\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}$ (metal charge density), $\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}$ (inner-layer contribution), $\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}$ (diffuse-layer contribution), and $\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}$ (total solution-side charge density), write the charge-balance relationship and interpret its sign.

**Solution (Exercise 5).** The charge-balance statement is $\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}=\sigma^{\mathrm{i}}+\sigma^{\mathrm{d}}=-\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}$.

The minus sign states that the excess metal charge density is balanced by equal-magnitude, opposite-sign charge in the adjacent solution. For example, if the metal is negatively charged ($\sigma^{\mathrm{m}}<0$), then the net solution-side charge density must be positive ($\sigma^{\mathrm{S}}>0$), arising from a combination of inner-layer and diffuse-layer ionic contributions.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Charge balance in the double layer
> **Lesson 1:** The metal-side excess charge is balanced by equal and opposite solution-side charge; splitting the solution-side charge into inner and diffuse components is a bookkeeping choice that helps connect models to physical structure.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** The IHP/OHP language is a way to name where compact-layer structure ends and where the diffuse (3D) screening distribution begins.
