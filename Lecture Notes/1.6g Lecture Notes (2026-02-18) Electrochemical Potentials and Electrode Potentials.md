# 1.6g Electrochemical Potentials and Electrode Potentials (February 18, 2026)

Electrochemical thermodynamics is built on a simple observation: when a species is charged, “where it wants to go” depends not only on composition (a chemical driving force) but also on electrical potential. The bookkeeping device that merges these contributions is the ==electrochemical potential==. Writing equilibrium conditions in terms of electrochemical potentials gives a compact route to the Nernst form for an ==electrode potential== at a metal/solution interface and clarifies why only potential differences (cell voltages) are directly measurable.

## 1.6g.1 Electrochemical potential: chemical part + electrical part

The chemical potential $\mu_i^\alpha$ of species $i$ in phase $\alpha$ describes how the Gibbs free energy changes when matter is transferred; for solutions it is convenient to express $\mu_i^\alpha$ in terms of an ==activity== $a_i^\alpha$ relative to a standard state. The electrical environment enters through the ==Galvani potential== $\phi^\alpha$ (the inner electrostatic potential of phase $\alpha$). For a species of charge number $z_i$ (so its charge is $z_iF$ per mole), the electrochemical potential is defined by adding the electrical work term to the chemical potential.

> [!definition] Activity
> The ==activity== $a_i^\alpha$ is the effective thermodynamic “concentration” of species $i$ in phase $\alpha$ that appears in equilibrium expressions; it is defined so that $\mu_i^\alpha=\mu_i^{\circ,\alpha}+RT\ln a_i^\alpha$.

> [!definition] Galvani potential
> The ==Galvani potential== $\phi^\alpha$ is the inner electrical potential of phase $\alpha$; for a charged species it contributes an electrical term $z_iF\phi^\alpha$ to the molar free energy.

> [!definition] Electrochemical potential
> The ==electrochemical potential== $\bar{\mu}_i^\alpha$ is the molar free energy of species $i$ in phase $\alpha$ including both chemical and electrical contributions: $\bar{\mu}_i^\alpha=\mu_i^\alpha+z_iF\phi^\alpha$.

> [!equation] Chemical potential from activity
> $$
> \mu_i^\alpha=\mu_i^{\circ,\alpha}+RT\ln a_i^\alpha
> $$

This equation says that the chemical contribution to the molar free energy is a standard-state baseline plus a composition-dependent term. The logarithm ensures that multiplicative changes in activity correspond to additive changes in $\mu_i^\alpha$, and non-ideal interactions are absorbed into $a_i^\alpha$ rather than changing the overall equilibrium bookkeeping.

> [!equation] Electrochemical potential (definition)
> $$
> \bar{\mu}_i^\alpha=\mu_i^\alpha+z_iF\phi^\alpha
> $$

This equation says that the molar free energy of a charged species includes an electrical-work contribution proportional to the phase’s Galvani potential. The factor $z_iF$ is the charge per mole, so the term $z_iF\phi^\alpha$ is the energetic cost (per mole) of placing that charge into a region at potential $\phi^\alpha$.

Two special cases recur in electrode thermodynamics.

First, for a pure, neutral condensed phase (e.g., $\mathrm{Zn}(s)$), one typically takes $a=1$ and $z=0$, so $\bar{\mu}=\mu=\mu^\circ$ under the chosen standard state.

Second, for an electron in a metal, $z_e=-1$, so the electrical term enters with a minus sign: $\bar{\mu}_e=\mu_e-F\phi$.



## 1.6g.2 Equilibrium conditions written with electrochemical potentials

> [!Questions] Questions: Equilibrium criteria using $\bar{\mu}$
> 1. What is the equilibrium condition for a single species $i$ distributed between two phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$?
> 
> 2. For a reaction written $\sum_k \nu_k A_k=0$, what is the electrochemical-potential equilibrium condition in terms of $\sum_k \nu_k\bar{\mu}_k$?
> 
> 3. In the stoichiometric convention used here, what do $\nu_k>0$ and $\nu_k<0$ correspond to?

At equilibrium, matter can be transferred without a net driving force. For a single species present in two phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$, this statement becomes equality of electrochemical potentials: if $\bar{\mu}_i^\alpha\neq \bar{\mu}_i^\beta$, the species has a thermodynamic incentive to move (or to react) so as to reduce the imbalance.

> [!equation] Equilibrium across phases (electrochemical potential)
> $$
> \bar{\mu}_i^\alpha=\bar{\mu}_i^\beta
> $$

This equation says that a species has no net thermodynamic incentive to transfer between phases at equilibrium: the “chemical + electrical” driving force is the same on both sides. If the electrochemical potentials differ, transport (and/or reaction) proceeds in the direction that reduces the imbalance.

For a chemical (or electrochemical) reaction written in the stoichiometric form $\sum_k \nu_k A_k=0$ (with $\nu_k>0$ for products and $\nu_k<0$ for reactants), the equilibrium condition can be stated compactly as the vanishing of the stoichiometric sum of electrochemical potentials.

> [!equation] Reaction equilibrium condition (electrochemical potentials)
> $$
> \sum_k \nu_k\,\bar{\mu}_k = 0
> $$

This equation says that, at equilibrium for the reaction as written, the net “per-mole reaction free-energy change” (including electrical contributions for charged species) is zero. It is the electrochemical-potential analog of the familiar equilibrium criterion $\sum_k \nu_k\mu_k=0$ for uncharged bookkeeping.

This way of writing equilibrium is especially convenient for electrode half-reactions because it automatically includes the electrical work required to move charged species between regions of different potential.

## 1.6g.3 Half-reaction equilibrium and the interfacial potential drop: $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}$

For a metal/solution interface supporting an electrode half-reaction, equilibrium can be written as a stoichiometric balance of electrochemical potentials. Rearranging that balance isolates the interfacial potential difference and motivates the definitions of the ==electrode potential== and the ==standard electrode potential== used in Nernst-type relations.

> [!Questions] Questions: Electrode potentials from $\bar{\mu}$
> 1. In the convention used here, how is the ==electrode potential== $E$ defined in terms of $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$ and $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ for a metal/solution interface?
> 
> 2. For $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2e^-(\mathrm{M}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}(s)$, which activities are typically taken as 1 under the pure-phase conventions, and which activity remains in the final Nernst dependence?
> 
> 3. When a half-reaction equilibrium is rearranged into a “constant + log(activity)” form, what kinds of terms are absorbed into the ==standard electrode potential== $E^\circ$?
> 
> 4. Under the stated sign convention, does $E$ increase or decrease when $a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}$ increases at fixed $T$?

> [!definition] Electrode potential
> The ==electrode potential== $E$ of a metal (M)/solution (S) interface is defined by the sign convention $E\equiv \phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$.


> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Deriving the $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}$ electrode potential from $\bar{\mu}$
> Consider the metal/solution half-reaction $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2e^-(\mathrm{M}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}(s,\mathrm{M})$ at equilibrium between a metal phase (M) and a solution phase (S).
> 
> Use $\bar{\mu}_i^\alpha=\mu_i^\alpha+z_iF\phi^\alpha$ and $\mu_i^\alpha=\mu_i^{\circ,\alpha}+RT\ln a_i^\alpha$.
> 
> Assume $\mathrm{Zn}(s)$ is a neutral pure phase with $a_{\mathrm{Zn}}=1$ and $z_{\mathrm{Zn}}=0$, and take $z_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}=+2$ and $z_e=-1$.
> 
> **Part A:** Write the equilibrium condition in terms of electrochemical potentials.
> 
> **Part B:** Substitute the defining relations and solve for $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}-\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$ in terms of $a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}$.
> 
> **Part C:** Define the electrode potential as $E\equiv \phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ and rewrite your result in the Nernst form $E=E^\circ+(RT/2F)\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}$, identifying what is absorbed into $E^\circ$.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** At equilibrium, the electrochemical-potential balance is
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\mathrm{M}}
=
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}} + 2\bar{\mu}_e^{\mathrm{M}}.
$$

For zinc metal (a neutral pure phase), take $z=0$ and $a=1$:
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}.
$$
For aqueous $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, use $\mu=\mu^\circ+RT\ln a$ and $z=+2$:
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}
=
\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}} + RT\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}} + 2F\phi^{\mathrm{S}}.
$$
For electrons in the metal, use $z_e=-1$:
$$
\bar{\mu}_e^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}-F\phi^{\mathrm{M}}.
$$
Combine these to obtain
$$
\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}
=
\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}} + RT\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}} + 2F\phi^{\mathrm{S}}
+
2\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}-2F\phi^{\mathrm{M}}.
$$
Rearranging isolates the Galvani potential difference across the interface:

> [!equation] Interfacial Galvani-potential drop for $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}$ (electrochemical-potential form)
> $$
> \phi^{\mathrm{S}}-\phi^{\mathrm{M}}
> =
> \frac{\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}-2\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}}{2F}
> -
> \frac{RT}{2F}\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}
> $$

This equation says that the interfacial Galvani-potential difference adjusts so that the electrochemical-potential balance for $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}(s)$ is satisfied. It separates a constant term (set by standard-state choices and the metal’s electron reference) from a composition-dependent term proportional to $\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}$.

It is common to define the electrode potential as the potential difference in the opposite direction,
$$
E \equiv \phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}} = -\!\left(\phi^{\mathrm{S}}-\phi^{\mathrm{M}}\right).
$$
Therefore,
$$
E
=
-\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}-2\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}}{2F}
+
\frac{RT}{2F}\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}.
$$

> [!definition] Standard electrode potential
> The ==standard electrode potential== $E^\circ$ of a half-reaction is the constant term in the Nernst form of the electrode potential under the defined standard-state and reference conventions.

Define the constant term as the standard electrode potential for this half-reaction under the convention $E=\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$:
$$
E^\circ_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}}
\equiv
-\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}-2\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}}{2F}.
$$
Substituting this definition gives the Nernst form

> [!equation] Nernst form for the $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}$ electrode (activity form)
> $$
> E
> =
> E^\circ_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}}
> +
> \frac{RT}{2F}\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{S}}
> $$

This equation says that, for a fixed temperature, the equilibrium electrode potential varies linearly with $\ln a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}$ and equals $E^\circ_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}}$ when the ionic activity is unity. The factor $RT/2F$ is the “thermodynamic slope” that converts a log change in activity into a voltage change, with the $2$ coming from the two-electron stoichiometry.

> **Lesson 1:** For an electrode half-reaction, write equilibrium as a balance of electrochemical potentials, then substitute $\bar{\mu}=\mu+zF\phi$ to make the interfacial potential difference appear explicitly.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Converting from $\phi^{\mathrm{S}}-\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$ to the electrode-potential convention $E=\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ flips the sign of the constant term and the activity term together, yielding a standard-plus-log form.

## 1.6g.4 What is measurable: electrode potentials vs. cell potentials

> [!Questions] Questions: What a voltmeter measures
> 1. Why does combining half-reactions into a full cell help eliminate non-measurable constants (such as electron chemical potentials in metals)?
> 
> 2. What role does a reference electrode play in turning electrode potentials into tabulated quantities?
> 
> 3. What is the difference between an interfacial potential difference (involving $\phi$) and a measured cell voltage?

The constant term in the interfacial relation above involves the electron chemical potential in the metal, which is not independently measurable for an isolated interface. For that reason, electrochemistry emphasizes differences of electrode potentials. A full cell combines two half-reactions, and the measured cell voltage corresponds to a difference of electrode potentials; choosing a reference electrode fixes a conventional zero and turns otherwise “absolute” constants into tabulated standard potentials.

> [!equation] Cell potential from half-cell potentials
> $$
> E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}
> $$

This equation says that a measured cell voltage is a difference of two electrode potentials, not an “absolute” potential of a single isolated interface. In practice, tabulated half-cell potentials are reported relative to a reference electrode so that only differences enter measured voltages.

> [!exercise] Exercise 2: Nernst form for a metal/ion half-reaction
> Consider the half-reaction $\mathrm{M}^{z+}(\mathrm{aq}) + ze^-(\mathrm{M}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{M}(s,\mathrm{M})$ at equilibrium between a metal phase (M) and a solution phase (S). Assume $\mathrm{M}(s)$ is a neutral pure phase with activity 1.
> 
> **Part A:** Starting from $\bar{\mu}_i=\mu_i+z_iF\phi$ and $\mu_i=\mu_i^\circ+RT\ln a_i$, derive an expression for $\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$ in terms of $a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}$.
> 
> **Part B:** Identify the combination of standard chemical potentials and electron chemical potential that can be grouped into a constant “standard electrode potential” term.

**Solution (Exercise 2).** At equilibrium,
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{M}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+z\,\bar{\mu}_e^{\mathrm{M}}.
$$
With $a_{\mathrm{M}}=1$ and $z_{\mathrm{M}}=0$, $\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{M}}^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}$. For the ion in solution, $z_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}=+z$ so
$$
\bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}=\mu_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}+RT\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+zF\phi^{\mathrm{S}}.
$$
For electrons, $\bar{\mu}_e^{\mathrm{M}}=\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}-F\phi^{\mathrm{M}}$. Substituting gives
$$
\mu_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}
=
\mu_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}+RT\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}+zF\phi^{\mathrm{S}}
+
z\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}-zF\phi^{\mathrm{M}}.
$$
Rearrange to isolate the interfacial potential difference:
$$
\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}
=
\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\circ,\mathrm{S}}-\mu_{\mathrm{M}}^{\circ,\mathrm{M}}+z\mu_e^{\mathrm{M}}}{zF}
+
\frac{RT}{zF}\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}.
$$
The first fraction is constant for a chosen metal and standard state; it is common to denote it by $E^\circ_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}/\mathrm{M}}$ so that the electrode potential takes the Nernst form $E=E^\circ+(RT/zF)\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}$ under the convention $E=\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$.

> [!equation] Nernst form for a metal/ion electrode (activity form)
> $$
> E = E^\circ_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}/\mathrm{M}}+\frac{RT}{zF}\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}^{\mathrm{S}}
> $$

This equation says that, under the convention $E=\phi^{\mathrm{M}}-\phi^{\mathrm{S}}$, the equilibrium electrode potential shifts by an amount proportional to $\ln a_{\mathrm{M}^{z+}}$ when the ionic activity changes. The coefficient $RT/zF$ sets the voltage change per multiplicative change in activity, with the $z$ reflecting the number of electrons coupled to the ion in the half-reaction.

> **Lesson 1:** For charged species, equilibrium is expressed by equality (or stoichiometric sums) of electrochemical potentials, which automatically includes electrical work terms.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Substituting $\bar{\mu}=\mu+zF\phi$ and $\mu=\mu^\circ+RT\ln a$ converts a half-reaction equilibrium statement into a Nernst-type dependence of an interfacial potential difference on $\ln a$.
