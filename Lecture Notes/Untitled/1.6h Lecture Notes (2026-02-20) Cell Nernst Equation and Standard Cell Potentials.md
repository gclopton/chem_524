# 1.6h Cell Nernst Equation and Standard Cell Potentials (February 20, 2026)

Electrode potentials are defined at interfaces, but measurements are made with a voltmeter connected between two metallic leads. The measurable quantity is therefore a difference of potentials between conductors, i.e., a cell voltage. When the cell operates reversibly, that cell voltage is directly tied to thermodynamics: the electrical work available per mole of reaction is the Gibbs free energy change. Combining that work relation with the activity dependence of reaction free energy produces the ==cell Nernst equation==, which relates $E_{\text{cell}}$ to composition through a ==reaction quotient==.

## 1.6h.1 Cell voltage as a free-energy statement

For a cell reaction that transfers $n$ moles of electrons through the external circuit per mole of reaction as written, the reversible electrical work per mole is $nF E_{\text{cell}}$. With the sign convention that a spontaneous galvanic cell has $E_{\text{cell}}>0$, the corresponding Gibbs free energy change is negative.

It is often convenient to package standard-state information into a ==standard cell potential== $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$ and a ==standard Gibbs free energy of reaction== $\Delta G_r^\circ$, which are related by division by $nF$.

> [!definition] Standard cell potential
> The ==standard cell potential== $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$ is the cell potential under the chosen standard-state conditions (activities set to their standard values, typically $a=1$), with the cell written in the spontaneous direction.

> [!definition] Standard Gibbs free energy of reaction
> The ==standard Gibbs free energy of reaction== $\Delta G_r^\circ$ is the Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction as written when all species are in their standard states.

> [!equation] Cell potential from reaction Gibbs free energy
> $$
> \Delta G_r = -nF E_{\text{cell}}
> $$

This equation says that, for reversible cell operation, the electrical driving force (a measurable voltage) is just the reaction Gibbs free energy expressed in electrical units. The factor $nF$ converts “volts” into “joules per mole of reaction” by counting how many moles of electrons are transferred per mole of net reaction and how much charge that corresponds to.

Under standard-state conditions this becomes

> [!equation] Standard free energy and standard cell potential
> $$
> \Delta G_r^\circ = -nF E_{\text{cell}}^\circ
> $$

This equation says that the tabulated “standard” voltage is a bookkeeping rewrite of a standard-state free energy change. At fixed $T$ and a fixed standard-state convention, $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$ is a constant for the net cell reaction as written in the spontaneous direction.

Because individual electrode potentials are not measured in isolation, standard potentials are typically provided as ==standard electrode potential== values for half-reactions under a stated reference convention. To assemble a full-cell voltage, use the cathode–anode sign convention:

> [!equation] Cell potential from half-cell potentials
> $$
> E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cathode}}-E_{\text{anode}}
> $$

This equation says that the measured cell voltage is the cathode potential minus the anode potential, using the same electrode-potential convention for both. When standard half-cell potentials are tabulated as reduction potentials, $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$ is computed by identifying which half-reaction is the cathode (reduction in the spontaneous cell direction) and which is the anode (oxidation in the spontaneous cell direction), then subtracting.

> The handwritten derivation specializes to a two-electron cell and shows how combining half-reaction electrochemical-potential balances cancels non-measurable metal-electron terms, leaving a measurable lead-to-lead potential difference $E$ written as a standard-state constant plus a logarithmic activity term. The activity ratio that appears under the logarithm has $a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}$ and $a_{\mathrm{H}_2}$ in the numerator and $a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2$ in the denominator, consistent with the net reaction $\mathrm{Zn}+2\mathrm{H}^+\rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_2$.

## 1.6h.2 Reaction free energy and the reaction quotient

Thermodynamics expresses reaction free energy in terms of a standard part and a composition-dependent part. For a general reaction written with stoichiometric coefficients $\nu_k$,
$$
\sum_k \nu_k A_k = 0,
$$
define the reaction quotient (in activities) as
$$
\mathcal{Q}\equiv \prod_k a_k^{\nu_k}.
$$

> [!definition] Reaction quotient
> The ==reaction quotient== $\mathcal{Q}$ is the activity product $\mathcal{Q}=\prod_k a_k^{\nu_k}$ for a reaction written $\sum_k \nu_k A_k=0$ (with $\nu_k>0$ for products and $\nu_k<0$ for reactants).

The Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction is then

> [!equation] Reaction Gibbs free energy (activity form)
> $$
> \Delta G_r = \Delta G_r^\circ + RT\ln \mathcal{Q}
> $$

This equation says that composition changes the reaction driving force only through the logarithm of the reaction quotient. In particular, $\mathcal{Q}=1$ corresponds to all activities at their standard-state values (so $\Delta G_r=\Delta G_r^\circ$), and at equilibrium $\mathcal{Q}$ equals the equilibrium constant for the reaction at that temperature (so $\Delta G_r=0$).

## 1.6h.3 The cell Nernst equation (activity form)

Combine the free-energy–voltage relation $\Delta G_r=-nF E_{\text{cell}}$ with $\Delta G_r=\Delta G_r^\circ+RT\ln\mathcal{Q}$ and use $\Delta G_r^\circ=-nF E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$. The result is the cell Nernst equation:

> [!equation] Nernst equation (cell, activity form)
> $$
> E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln \mathcal{Q}
> $$

This form makes two points explicit. First, $E_{\text{cell}}^\circ$ is the part of the driving force set by standard states (a constant at fixed $T$). Second, departures from standard composition shift the cell voltage by a term proportional to $\ln \mathcal{Q}$.

> 2. What does the cell Nernst equation predict when $\mathcal{Q}=1$?
> 3. Holding $T$ fixed, how does increasing product activities (increasing $\mathcal{Q}$) affect $E_{\text{cell}}$?

> The annotated page derives a cell-level Nernst relation by writing electrochemical potentials for each species in the half-reactions, then combining them so that internal metal-electron terms cancel. The bottom line is a lead-to-lead potential difference proportional to $-\Delta G_r^\circ$ plus a $-RT\ln(\cdots)$ correction whose argument is the activity reaction quotient for the net cell reaction.

## 1.6h.4 Example: the $\mathrm{Zn}/\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ electrode paired with the hydrogen couple

Consider combining the $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}/\mathrm{Zn}$ half-reaction with the hydrogen half-reaction:
$$
\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}(s),
\qquad
2\mathrm{H}^+(\mathrm{aq})+2e^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_2(g).
$$
Writing the net reaction in the spontaneous direction for zinc oxidation and hydrogen reduction gives
$$
\mathrm{Zn}(s)+2\mathrm{H}^+(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_2(g),
$$
so $n=2$ and
$$
\mathcal{Q}=\frac{a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}\,a_{\mathrm{H}_2}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2}.
$$
Therefore,
$$
E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - \frac{RT}{2F}\ln\!\left(\frac{a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}\,a_{\mathrm{H}_2}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2}\right).
$$
In this example the zinc metal is a pure phase, so its activity is taken as 1 and does not appear in $\mathcal{Q}$.

## 1.6h.5 Worked exercise: composition dependence of cell voltage

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Applying the cell Nernst equation
> For the cell reaction $\mathrm{Zn}(s)+2\mathrm{H}^+(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_2(g)$ at temperature $T$, assume activities are well-defined and the cell behaves reversibly.
> 
> **Part A:** Write the reaction quotient $\mathcal{Q}$ in terms of activities.
> 
> **Part B:** Starting from $E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - (RT/nF)\ln\mathcal{Q}$, obtain an explicit expression for $E_{\text{cell}}$ for this reaction.
> 
> **Part C:** Holding $a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}$ and $a_{\mathrm{H}_2}$ fixed, state whether increasing $a_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ increases or decreases $E_{\text{cell}}$.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** **Part A:** The reaction quotient (using activities and taking $a_{\mathrm{Zn}(s)}=1$) is
$$
\mathcal{Q}=\frac{a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}\,a_{\mathrm{H}_2}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2}.
$$

**Part B:** Here $n=2$, so the cell Nernst equation gives
$$
E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - \frac{RT}{2F}\ln\!\left(\frac{a_{\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}}\,a_{\mathrm{H}_2}}{a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2}\right).
$$

**Part C:** Increasing $a_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ decreases $\mathcal{Q}$ because $a_{\mathrm{H}^+}$ appears in the denominator as $a_{\mathrm{H}^+}^2$. Since $E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - (RT/2F)\ln\mathcal{Q}$, decreasing $\mathcal{Q}$ makes $\ln\mathcal{Q}$ more negative, which increases $E_{\text{cell}}$.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Cell Nernst workflow
> **Lesson 1:** Write the net cell reaction first, then read $n$ (electrons transferred) and $\mathcal{Q}$ directly from stoichiometry using activities.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** The sign in $E_{\text{cell}} = E_{\text{cell}}^\circ - (RT/nF)\ln\mathcal{Q}$ means that increasing product activities (increasing $\mathcal{Q}$) lowers $E_{\text{cell}}$, while increasing reactant activities (decreasing $\mathcal{Q}$) raises $E_{\text{cell}}$.
