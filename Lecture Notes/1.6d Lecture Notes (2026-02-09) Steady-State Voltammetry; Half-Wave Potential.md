# 1.6d Steady-State Voltammetry; Half-Wave Potential (February 9, 2026)

In many voltammetric experiments the current is ultimately limited by the rate at which reactants are transported to the electrode and products are transported away. When transport establishes a time-independent concentration field near the electrode, the current reaches a steady state and the current–potential response can be expressed in closed form by combining (i) a mass-transfer relation for surface concentrations with (ii) a Nernst relation that connects potential to the surface composition ratio. This section develops the steady-state $i$–$E$ expression for a reversible couple and introduces the half-wave potential as a practical reference point on a sigmoidal steady-state wave.

## 1.6d.1 Steady state in electrode mass transport

> [!Questions] Questions: Steady state in electrode mass transport
> 1. In the context of electrode mass transport, what does it mean for the concentration field to be at steady state?
> 2. Give two experimental or geometric mechanisms that can produce a bounded diffusion field (and therefore steady state) near an electrode.
> 3. In a time trace $i(t)$ after a potential perturbation, what qualitative behavior distinguishes a transient that will decay to zero from a response that approaches a steady-state plateau?

> [!definition] Steady state (mass transport)
> In electrode mass transport, ==steady state== means that the concentration field $C(x,t)$ no longer changes with time over the measurement window, so the flux and current become time-independent.

Steady state is most naturally realized when diffusion fields do not grow indefinitely with time. This can occur because of geometry (e.g., microelectrodes), hydrodynamics (e.g., rotation), or confinement (e.g., thin-layer conditions), all of which can maintain a bounded diffusion layer and thus a time-independent flux.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Reaching steady state in a diffusion layer
> 1. Sketch axes for a concentration profile $C(x,t)$ versus distance $x$ from a planar electrode (with $x=0$ at the electrode).
> 2. On the same axes, draw (i) an initial uniform bulk concentration profile at $t=0$ and (ii) a sequence of intermediate profiles that evolve toward a time-independent steady-state profile.
> 3. Indicate on your steady-state profile what feature determines the diffusion flux to the electrode (and therefore the steady-state current).

> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-09 Figure 1 steady-state concentration profile.png]]
> The plot shows a concentration field $C(x,t)$ adjacent to a planar electrode at $x=0$. The red horizontal line labeled $t=0$ represents an initially uniform bulk concentration, while the family of profiles illustrates how the concentration gradient develops with time near the electrode.
> 
> The blue line labeled “steady state” represents the time-independent profile that is reached once the diffusion field stops changing in time. The note “slope = concentration gradient $\propto$ flux” emphasizes that, at steady state, the diffusion flux (and therefore the steady-state current) is controlled by the near-surface concentration gradient.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Electrode/flow configurations that produce steady state
> 1. Sketch two electrode geometries that can produce steady-state diffusion by geometry (for example, a spherical mercury drop and a microelectrode disk). Label which geometry you drew in each case.
> 2. Sketch one configuration that produces steady state by convection (for example, a rotating disk electrode or a thin-layer flow cell). Label the flow/rotation qualitatively (e.g., with a curved arrow).

> The upper sketches list electrode geometries that can support steady-state diffusion fields (a spherical Hg drop and a microelectrode disk), where the diffusion geometry prevents the diffusion layer from growing without bound.
> 
> The lower sketches list convective approaches (“convection steady state”), including a rotating disk electrode and a thin-layer flow cell, which maintain a bounded mass-transfer layer by hydrodynamics/flow.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Transient vs. steady-state current in time
> 1. Sketch axes of current $i$ versus time $t$ following an applied potential perturbation.
> 2. On the same axes, draw one response that decays toward $i\to 0$ as $t\to\infty$, and a second response that approaches a nonzero steady-state plateau.
> 3. Label which trace corresponds to a steady-state current and which corresponds to a purely transient response.

> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-09 Figure 3 current transient vs steady state.png]]
> The blue trace decays toward $i\to 0$ as $t\to\infty$, representing a response that does not maintain a time-independent transport field over long times.
> 
> The red trace approaches a nonzero plateau labeled “steady state,” illustrating the experimental signature of a bounded diffusion/mass-transfer layer: after initial transients, the current becomes time-independent.




## 1.6d.2 Mass transfer coefficients for oxidized and reduced forms

> [!Questions] Questions: Mass transfer coefficients and limiting current
> 1. In the diffusion-layer (film) approximation, what does a mass-transfer coefficient $m$ convert, and what does it output?
> 2. In this section’s notation, what does the superscript “$*$” mean, and what does $(x=0)$ mean?
> 3. For a cathodic (reduction) wave, what near-surface condition defines the cathodic limiting current?
> 4. If $m_{\mathrm{O}}$ increases while $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ and all other parameters are fixed, what qualitative change do you expect in the limiting-current plateau?

> [!definition] Mass-transfer coefficient
> The ==mass-transfer coefficient== $m$ is a lumped parameter that converts a bulk-to-surface concentration difference into a steady-state flux, typically written $J\approx m\,(C^*-C(x=0))$ (with $m=D/\delta$ in the diffusion-layer approximation).

Consider a reversible couple written as
$$
\mathrm{O}+ne^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}.
$$
At steady state, the interfacial reaction rate is set by the transport-controlled arrival of $\mathrm{O}$ at the surface and the transport-controlled removal of $\mathrm{R}$ from the surface. In the diffusion-layer approximation, the steady-state flux of each species is written in terms of its own mass-transfer coefficient:
$$
J_{\mathrm{O}}\approx m_{\mathrm{O}}\,[C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)],
\qquad
J_{\mathrm{R}}\approx m_{\mathrm{R}}\,[C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)-C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}].
$$
The current equals $nFA$ times the net flux, and at steady state the same current must be supported by both the consumption of $\mathrm{O}$ and the production of $\mathrm{R}$:
$$
i=nFA\,J_{\mathrm{O}}=nFA\,J_{\mathrm{R}}.
$$

In the common cathodic-wave case where $C_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\approx 0$ in bulk, these relations can be inverted to express the surface concentrations in terms of the current:
$$
C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)=\frac{i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{R}}},
\qquad
C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}-\frac{i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}}.
$$
It is convenient to define the ==cathodic limiting current== as the diffusion-limited plateau current reached when $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\approx 0$.

> [!definition] Cathodic limiting current
> The ==cathodic limiting current== $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$ is the diffusion-limited plateau current for a reduction wave, obtained when the surface concentration of the oxidized form becomes negligible, $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)\approx 0$.

Under that condition,
$$
i_{\mathrm{L,c}}=nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}\,C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*},
$$
so that the oxidized-form surface concentration can be written directly in terms of $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$:
$$
C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}}.
$$

> [!equation] Cathodic limiting current (film approximation)
> $$
> i_{\mathrm{L,c}}=nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}\,C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}
> $$

This equation says that the cathodic limiting current is the transport-limited plateau current set by the bulk oxidized-form concentration and the oxidized-form mass-transfer coefficient. In the diffusion-layer approximation, increasing $m_{\mathrm{O}}$ (stronger transport) or increasing $C_{\mathrm{O}}^{*}$ increases $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$ linearly, while $n$ and $A$ scale the current through electron stoichiometry and electrode size.

> [!equation] Surface concentrations in steady-state mass transport (film approximation)
> $$
> C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)=\frac{i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{R}}},
> \qquad
> C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)=\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}}
> $$

This equation says that, at steady state, the current fixes the surface composition by transport: producing $\mathrm{R}$ at rate proportional to $i$ forces a nonzero $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)$, while consuming $\mathrm{O}$ drives $C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$ downward from its bulk value. As $i\to i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$, the oxidized-form surface concentration approaches zero, consistent with the definition of a cathodic limiting current.



> [!draw-it] Draw-it: How potential drives the system toward a diffusion limit
> 1. Sketch axes of concentration $C(x,t)$ versus distance $x$ from the electrode ($x=0$ at the surface).
> 2. Draw a family of steady-state concentration profiles for the oxidized form as the applied potential is made more negative, indicating that the near-surface concentration decreases and the gradient steepens.
> 3. Draw and label the diffusion-limited case in which the surface concentration of the oxidized form is driven to (approximately) zero.

> [!figure] Figure 1.6d.4: Steady-state concentration profiles as potential is driven toward the diffusion-limited regime
> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-09 Figure 4 concentration profiles vs potential and diffusion limit.png]]
> The sketch shows a concentration profile $C(x,t)$ adjacent to a planar electrode at $x=0$ for an $\mathrm{O}+ne^- \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}$ system. A vertical annotation indicates “$E$ more negative,” emphasizing that driving the potential cathodically increases consumption of $\mathrm{O}$ at the surface.
> 
> The family of profiles illustrates that, as the system is driven more negative, the steady-state concentration gradient steepens (larger flux), and the surface concentration decreases. The line labeled “diffusion limited” represents the limiting case where the oxidized-form surface concentration is driven toward zero, consistent with the definition of a cathodic limiting current.






## 1.6d.3 Steady-state $i$–$E$ relation for a reversible couple

> [!Questions] Questions: Steady-state waves and the half-wave potential
> 1. What two ingredients are combined to obtain a steady-state $i$–$E$ relation for a reversible $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$ couple under transport control?
> 2. Define the half-wave potential $E_{1/2}$ in terms of the limiting current and the measured current.
> 3. If $m_{\mathrm{O}}=m_{\mathrm{R}}$, what relationship between $E_{1/2}$ and $E^{0}$ follows from the mass-transfer correction?
> 4. What does the limiting-current plateau represent physically, in terms of the surface concentration of the oxidized form?

> [!definition] Half-wave potential
> The ==half-wave potential== $E_{1/2}$ is the potential on a steady-state sigmoidal wave at which the current equals one half of the cathodic limiting current, $i=i_{\mathrm{L,c}}/2$.

When the interfacial couple remains Nernstian (equilibrated) at the surface, the potential depends on the surface ratio $C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)/C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)$. Using the base-10 concentration form at $298\ \mathrm{K}$,
$$
E = E^{0} - \frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right),
$$
and substituting the steady-state surface concentrations yields an explicit relationship between $E$ and $i$.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Steady-state sigmoidal $i$–$E$ wave and limiting-current plateau
> 1. Sketch axes of current $i$ versus potential $E$ for a cathodic steady-state voltammogram, and indicate the direction of increasing negative potential.
> 2. Draw a qualitative sigmoidal wave that rises to a diffusion-limited plateau. Label the plateau current as $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$.

> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-09 Figure 5 steady-state i-E wave with limiting current.png]]
> The plot shows a qualitative steady-state current–potential response: as the potential is driven in the direction of increasing cathodic driving force (“increasing negativity”), the current rises from near zero to a transport-limited plateau labeled “diffusion limited.”
> 
> The plateau corresponds to the cathodic limiting current $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$, reached when the oxidized-form surface concentration becomes negligibly small and further increases in driving force cannot increase the transport rate.

> [!draw-it] Draw-it: Marking the half-wave potential on a steady-state wave
> 1. Sketch a steady-state sigmoidal $i$–$E$ wave with a limiting current $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$.
> 2. Mark the current level $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}/2$ on the vertical axis and draw a horizontal guide to the wave.
> 3. Drop a vertical guide to the potential axis and label that potential as $E_{1/2}$.

> ![[Lecture Notes/images/Lecture 2026-02-09 Figure 7 E0 to E1-2 schematic.png]]
> The annotation “Importance $E^{0}\rightarrow E_{1/2}$” emphasizes that, in steady-state voltammetry, the most convenient reference point on the observable wave is often the half-wave potential rather than the formal standard potential.
> 
> The red sketch of a sigmoidal wave indicates that $E_{1/2}$ is read from the measured curve, and (for a reversible system) differs from $E^{0}$ by a mass-transfer correction that depends on the ratio of transport coefficients for $\mathrm{R}$ and $\mathrm{O}$.

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Deriving the steady-state wave and the half-wave potential

> $$
> 
> **Part A:** Derive an expression for $E$ as a function of $i$ and $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$.
> 
> **Part B:** Define the half-wave potential $E_{1/2}$ as the potential at which $i=i_{\mathrm{L,c}}/2$. Express $E_{1/2}$ in terms of $E^{0}$, $m_{\mathrm{R}}$, and $m_{\mathrm{O}}$.
> 
> **Part C:** Rewrite your final $E(i)$ result in terms of $E_{1/2}$ and the dimensionless current ratio $(i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i$.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** Substitute the steady-state surface concentrations into the Nernst equation:
$$
\begin{aligned}
E
&=E^{0}-\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{R}}(x=0)}{C_{\mathrm{O}}(x=0)}\right) \\
&=E^{0}-\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(
\frac{\dfrac{i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{R}}}}{\dfrac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{nFA\,m_{\mathrm{O}}}}
\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
Cancel the common factor $nFA$:
$$
E
=E^{0}-\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(
\frac{i}{m_{\mathrm{R}}}\,\frac{m_{\mathrm{O}}}{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}
\right).
$$
Rearrange the argument of the logarithm:
$$
\frac{i}{m_{\mathrm{R}}}\,\frac{m_{\mathrm{O}}}{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}
=\frac{m_{\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\mathrm{R}}}\,\frac{i}{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i},
$$
so
$$
\begin{aligned}
E
&=E^{0}-\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{O}}}{m_{\mathrm{R}}}\right)
 -\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i}{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}\right) \\
&=E^{0}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}}\right)
 +\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
By definition, the half-wave potential satisfies $i=i_{\mathrm{L,c}}/2$. Substituting that value into the expression above makes the second logarithm vanish because its argument equals 1:
$$
\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right)
\Bigg|_{i=i_{\mathrm{L,c}}/2}
=\log_{10}(1)=0.
$$
Therefore,
$$
E_{1/2}=E^{0}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}}\right),
$$
and the $E(i)$ relation can be written compactly as
$$
E=E_{1/2}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right).
$$

> [!equation] Half-wave potential (mass-transfer corrected)
> $$
> E_{1/2}=E^{0}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{R}}}{m_{\mathrm{O}}}\right)
> $$

This equation says that the half-wave potential equals the standard potential plus a correction that accounts for unequal transport of $\mathrm{R}$ and $\mathrm{O}$ under steady-state conditions. If $m_{\mathrm{R}}=m_{\mathrm{O}}$, the correction vanishes and $E_{1/2}=E^{0}$; otherwise the shift is logarithmic in the ratio $m_{\mathrm{R}}/m_{\mathrm{O}}$.

> [!equation] Steady-state $i$–$E$ relation (reversible couple with cathodic limiting current)
> $$
> E=E_{1/2}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right)
> $$

This equation says that a reversible steady-state wave is sigmoidal: the potential varies logarithmically with the dimensionless ratio $(i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i$, which measures how far the current is from the limiting-current plateau. The prefactor $0.059/n$ (at $298\ \mathrm{K}$, base-10 form) sets the slope scale and shows that increasing $n$ makes the wave “steeper” in $E$.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Steady-state waves and $E_{1/2}$
> **Lesson 1:** A steady-state sigmoidal wave can be obtained by combining a mass-transfer relation for surface concentrations with a Nernst relation that fixes the surface composition ratio.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** The half-wave potential $E_{1/2}$ equals the potential at which the surface ratio makes the Nernst logarithm vanish; in steady-state transport, it is generally shifted from $E^{0}$ by a term involving $m_{\mathrm{R}}/m_{\mathrm{O}}$.

## 1.6d.4 Linearization and slope extraction

> [!Questions] Questions: Linearization and extracting $n$
> 1. In the linearized steady-state plot, what dimensionless quantity is used on the vertical axis, and what measured quantities does it depend on?
> 2. At fixed temperature, what does the slope of the linearized plot tell you about the electron stoichiometry $n$?
> 3. What assumption about the interfacial couple must hold for the linearization to be valid?

The steady-state relation can be rearranged to a form that emphasizes how the number of electrons $n$ appears in the slope of a linear plot. Starting from
$$
E=E_{1/2}+\frac{0.059}{n}\,\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right),
$$
solve for the logarithm:
$$
\log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right)=\frac{n}{0.059}\,(E-E_{1/2}).
$$

> [!equation] Linearized steady-state Nernst plot (slope form)
> $$
> \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i}{i}\right)=\frac{n}{0.059}\,(E-E_{1/2})
> $$

This equation says that, for a reversible couple under steady-state transport control, the dimensionless current ratio $(i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i$ varies exponentially with potential, so its base-10 logarithm varies linearly with $E$. At $298\ \mathrm{K}$, the expected slope of a plot of $\log_{10}\!\big((i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i\big)$ versus $E$ is $n/0.059$, providing a route to estimating $n$ from experimental steady-state data.

> [!exercise] Exercise 2: Estimating $n$ from a linearized steady-state plot
> At $T\approx 298\ \mathrm{K}$, a reversible steady-state wave is measured and the cathodic limiting current $i_{\mathrm{L,c}}$ is determined from the plateau.
> 
> A linearized plot of the quantity $y=\log_{10}\!\big((i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i\big)$ versus potential $E$ is found to be approximately linear over a central region, with best-fit slope
> $$
> \frac{dy}{dE}=33.9\ \mathrm{V}^{-1}.
> $$
> 
> Estimate the electron stoichiometry $n$ for the couple.

**Solution (Exercise 2).** In the linearized steady-state relation at $298\ \mathrm{K}$, the slope of the $y$ versus $E$ plot is $n/0.059$ (in units of V$^{-1}$). Therefore,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dE}
&=\frac{n}{0.059} \\
33.9
&=\frac{n}{0.059} \\
n
&=33.9\,(0.059) \\
&=2.0001 \\
&\approx 2.
\end{aligned}
$$
So the data are consistent with a two-electron process.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: Linearizing a steady-state wave
> **Lesson 1:** To extract $n$ from a reversible steady-state wave, rewrite the $i$–$E$ relation so the dimensionless ratio $(i_{\mathrm{L,c}}-i)/i$ appears inside a logarithm, then use the slope of the linearized plot.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** The linearization method relies on Nernstian (surface-equilibrated) behavior; significant kinetic limitations or uncompensated resistance can distort the slope and shift the inferred $n$.
