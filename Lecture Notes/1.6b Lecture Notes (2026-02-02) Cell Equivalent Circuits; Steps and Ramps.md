# 1.6b Cell Equivalent Circuits; Voltage/Current Excitations; Double-Layer Charging Transients (February 2, 2026)

Electrochemical measurements necessarily couple interfacial physics (charge stored in the double layer) to bulk transport of charge through the electrolyte (a finite solution resistance). Even when no faradaic reaction occurs, an applied excitation—such as a voltage step, a current step, or a voltage ramp—produces measurable transients because the electrode/solution interface behaves capacitively. This section develops a minimal equivalent-circuit model and derives the characteristic responses that are repeatedly used to interpret charging (non-faradaic) data and to estimate the double-layer capacitance.

In a controlled electrochemical experiment, one typically treats either the potential difference (between working and reference) or the current as the imposed input, and observes the conjugate quantity as the output:

**Potential-controlled mode:** In potential-controlled mode (potentiostatic operation), the input is the applied potential (a specified $E(t)$ or $\Delta E(t)$ ), and the output you observe is the resulting current $i(t)$.

**Current-controlled mode:** In current-controlled mode (galvanostatic operation), the input is the applied current (a specified $i(t)$ ), and the output you observe is the resulting potential $E(t)$ (or $\Delta E(t)$ ).

In a non-faradaic window, the transient response comes from charging and discharging the electrical double layer at the interface. Physically, changing the input forces a rearrangement of interfacial charge (metal-side excess charge and the solution-side countercharge), so the measured transient is dominated by the capacitive charging current $i_{\mathrm{C}}=d q / d t=C_{\mathrm{d}} d E / d t$ (plus any adsorption-related charging if present).

## 1.6b.2 A minimal equivalent circuit for double-layer charging



> [!definition] Solution resistance
> The **solution resistance** $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the effective resistance of the electrolyte path that current must traverse between electrodes. When current flows, it produces an Ohmic drop $E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}=iR_{\mathrm{s}}$.



> [!definition] Double-layer capacitance
> The **double-layer capacitance** $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ is the capacitance associated with charge stored in the electrode/solution double layer. In a non-faradaic window, interfacial current largely reflects charging and discharging of this capacitance.

Two kinematic relations are used repeatedly in charging calculations: current is the time rate of change of stored charge, and stored charge is the time integral of current.

> [!equation] Charge–current relations
> $$
> i(t)=\frac{dq}{dt}
> $$
> 
> $$
> q(t)=\int_{0}^{t} i(t')\,dt'
> $$

These equations say that current is the time rate of change of stored charge, and (equivalently) that the stored charge at time $t$ is the time integral of the current from $0$ to $t$. In the equivalent-circuit setting of this chapter, $q(t)$ is the interfacial charge stored on the effective capacitance, so these relations are the bridge from an applied excitation to a predicted transient current.

For a simple picture, the interfacial region at the working electrode is modeled as a capacitor $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ in series with a solution resistance $R_{\mathrm{s}}$. In some experimental configurations, additional interfacial capacitances can contribute in series with the working-electrode double layer (for example, an effective capacitance associated with the reference electrode), which is often represented by a second capacitor $C_{\mathrm{SCE}}$ in the same series branch. In that case, the external circuit “sees” an effective capacitance equal to the series combination.

> [!equation] Series combination of interfacial capacitances
> $$
> \frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{tot}}}=\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}+\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{SCE}}}
> $$

This equation says that series capacitors add by reciprocals: the smallest capacitance dominates the total. In particular, if one capacitance is much smaller than the other, then $C_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is close to that smaller value.

The simplest “geometry-to-capacitance” relationship used in circuit models is the parallel-plate expression. It is a model (not a literal statement about the interface geometry), but it correctly emphasizes that capacitance scales with area and permittivity and inversely with an effective separation distance.

> [!equation] Parallel-plate capacitance model
> $$
> C=\varepsilon\,\varepsilon_{0}\,\frac{A}{d}
> $$

This equation says that increasing the effective area $A$ (or permittivity $\varepsilon\varepsilon_0$) increases capacitance, while increasing the effective separation $d$ decreases capacitance. In interfacial modeling, it serves mainly as a scaling guide rather than a literal geometric claim.




[The exercises need to be renumbered.]


> [!exercise] Title
> Draw the circuit that represents the double layer in the series model. What is the voltage across the double-layer capacitor?




In the series model, the double layer is represented as an (ideal) capacitor with capacitance $C_{\mathrm{d}}$. For an ideal capacitor, the defining constitutive relation is

$$
q=C V
$$

so the **voltage across the capacitor** is


$$V=\frac{q}{C}$$


Here the "voltage" across the double-layer capacitor is being written as $E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}$, so

>The circuit sketch at the top-left defines a voltage-step experiment for a series resistor–capacitor model: an applied step $\Delta E$ is partitioned into a capacitive drop across the double layer ($\Delta E_{C_d}$) and an Ohmic drop across the solution resistance ($\Delta E_{R_s}$). The note $q=E\times C$ indicates the capacitor relation between stored charge and capacitor voltage.



In the $R_{\mathrm{s}}-C_{\mathrm{d}}$ series model, the applied potential step (or imposed interfacial potential difference) $\Delta E$ is shared between the solution resistance and the double-layer capacitor. The partition follows directly from Kirchhoff's voltage law plus the element laws for a resistor and a capacitor.

Because $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ are in series, the same current $i(t)$ flows through both elements. Writing Kirchhoff's voltage law around the loop gives

$$
\Delta E(t)=E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}(t)+E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}(t) .
$$


For the solution resistance, Ohm's law gives the ohmic drop

$$
E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}(t)=i(t) R_{\mathrm{s}} .
$$


For the double-layer capacitor, the capacitor constitutive relation is $q=C E$, so the capacitor voltage is

$$
E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}(t)=\frac{q(t)}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} .
$$


Substituting these two element relations into the KVL partition yields the desired expression:

$$
\Delta E(t)=i(t) R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q(t)}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} .
$$


> [!equation] Voltage partition in the $R_{\mathrm{s}}$–$C_{\mathrm{d}}$ series model
> $$
> \Delta E = E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}+E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}} = iR_{\mathrm{s}} + \frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}
> $$

This equation says that the applied step voltage $\Delta E$ splits into an Ohmic drop across the solution resistance ($iR_{\mathrm{s}}$) and a capacitive drop across the double layer ($q/C_{\mathrm{d}}$). It is the starting point for the step-response differential equation once $i=dq/dt$ is substituted.

Because the charging current is the time derivative of the stored charge, $i=dq/dt$, the voltage-step problem reduces to a first-order linear differential equation. Solving it gives the standard exponential charge accumulation and exponential current decay.


The same result written purely in terms of current, use $i=d q / d t$ to write $q(t)=q(0)+ \int_0^t i(\tau) d \tau$, giving

$$
\Delta E(t)=i(t) R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q(0)}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}+\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} \int_0^t i(\tau) d \tau .
$$


That's the full voltage partition for the series $R_{\mathrm{s}}-C_{\mathrm{d}}$ interface model.

> Shows the current step to a constant value $i$ applied over a finite time window (shown as a rectangular pulse in $i$ vs. $t$).



If a constant current $i$ is imposed for $t \geq 0$, then

$$
q(t)=q(0)+\int_0^t i d \tau=q(0)+i t
$$


In the common "uncharged at $t=0$ " setup, $q(0)=0$  and so we have for $q(t)$:
$$
q(t)=\int_{0}^{t} i\,dt = it.
$$


The series model gives
$$
E(t)=E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}+E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}=iR_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q(t)}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}.
$$
Under a constant current step, $q(t)=\int_0^t i\,dt=it$, so
$$
E(t)=iR_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{it}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}=i\!\left(R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{t}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}\right).
$$



> [!figure]
> ![[Pasted image 20260228104200.png|300]]


Thus, the $E$-vs-$t$ plot is a straight line with intercept $iR_{\mathrm{s}}$ and slope $i/C_{\mathrm{d}}$.

> $$

This equation says that a constant imposed current produces a potential that grows linearly in time, with an immediate Ohmic offset $iR_{\mathrm{s}}$ and a capacitive ramp whose slope is $i/C_{\mathrm{d}}$.

Starting from the voltage partition,
$$
\Delta E = iR_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}},
$$
substitute $i=dq/dt$:
$$
\Delta E = R_{\mathrm{s}}\frac{dq}{dt}+\frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}.
$$

A first-order linear ODE can be written as

> [!Equation] Standard Form of a Linear ODE
> $\frac{d y}{d t}+P(t) y=Q(t)$


Now we rearrange the expression for the potential into this standard linear form by dividing by $R_{s}$:


$$
\frac{dq}{dt}+\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}}}\,q=\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}.
$$

So the correspondences are :

$$\boxed{y \equiv q(t), \quad P(t)=\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}, \quad Q(t)=\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}}$$

For $\frac{d y}{d t}+P(t) y=Q(t)$, the integrating factor is: 


> [!equation] Integrating Factor of a Linear ODE
> 
> $$\mu(t)=\exp \left(\int P(t) d t\right)$$
> 
> 


Here $P(t)$ is constant, so

$$
\mu(t)=\exp \left(\int \frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} d t\right)=\exp \left(\frac{t}{R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}}\right)
$$


From this, we can define the time constant as:




> [!Equation] R-C Time Constant
> $$
\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}}.
$$


Verbally, the time constant $\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$ is the characteristic time scale for the interface to "mostly finish" charging after you change the input.



The general solution is:


> [!equation] General Solution of a Linear ODE
> $$y(t)=\frac{1}{\mu(t)}\left[\int \mu(t) Q(t) d t+C\right]$$


[you skipped an integration here when you plug mu into y(t), right?]



With $q(0)=0$ (uncharged capacitor immediately before the step), the solution is



> [!equation] Voltage-step stored charge (non-faradaic, $R_{\mathrm{s}}$–$C_{\mathrm{d}}$ model)
> $$
> q(t)=\Delta E\,C_{\mathrm{d}}\!\left(1-e^{-t/(R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}})}\right)
> $$

Stored charge approaches its long-time limit at


$$q(\infty)=\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} \Delta E C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)=\Delta E C_{\mathrm{d}}$$


and so 

$$q(\tau)=\Delta E C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-1}\right) \approx 0.63 q(\infty)$$

 
This means that the time it takes the capacitor charge $q(t)$ (and the double-layer voltage) to reach $1-e^{-1} \approx 63 \%$ of its final value $q(\infty)=\Delta E C_{\mathrm{d}}$.



Differentiate to obtain the current:
$$
i(t)=\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\,e^{-t/(R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}})}.
$$


> [!equation] Voltage-step charging current (non-faradaic, $R_{\mathrm{s}}$–$C_{\mathrm{d}}$ model)
> $$
> i(t)=\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\,e^{-t/(R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}})}
> $$

The initial value of the current is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i(t) & =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} e^{-t /\left(R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}\right)} \\
i\left(0^{+}\right) & =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} e^{-0^{+} /\left(R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}\right)} \\
& =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} e^{-\left(0^{+}\right)} \\
& =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} e^0 \\
& =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}(1) \\
& =\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} .
\end{aligned}
$$


This equation says that the charging current decays exponentially from its initial value $i(0^+)=\Delta E/R_{\mathrm{s}}$. From this we can define the time constant as At $t=\tau$, the current is
$$
i(\tau)=\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\,e^{-1}\approx 0.37\,\frac{\Delta E}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}.
$$

This represents the time it takes the current $i(t)$ to decay to $e^{-1} \approx 37 \%$ of its initial value $i\left(0^{+}\right)= \Delta E / R_{\mathrm{s}}$.

So altogether $\tau$ is the time for the capacitor to reach about $\mathbf{6 3} \boldsymbol{\%}$ of its final charge and for the current to fall to about $37 \%$ of its initial value.

We model the non-faradaic interface as a series combination of a solution resistance $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ and a doublelayer capacitance $C_{\mathrm{d}}$. Because the elements are in series, the same current $i(t)$ flows through both, and the applied potential $E(t)$ partitions as

$$
E(t)=E_{R_{\mathrm{s}}}(t)+E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}(t)=i(t) R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q(t)}{C_{\mathrm{d}}}
$$


Throughout, we use the capacitor relation $q=C_{\mathrm{d}} E_{C_{\mathrm{d}}}$ and $i(t)=d q / d t$.



Given the endpoints $\left(t_1, E_1\right)$ and $\left(t_2, E_2\right)$, the scan rate is:


$$v=\frac{E_2-E_1}{t_2-t_1},$$


For a ramp beginning at $t_1=0$ with $E(0)=E_1$, we have $E(t)=E_1+v t$. If additionally, we choose $E_1=0$, then $E(t)=v t$. So from this, the scan rate is:


> [!equation] Instantaneous Scan Rate
> $$v=\frac{d E}{d t} \quad$$ 


with units $\quad[v]=\mathrm{V} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.


Start from the voltage partition

$$
E(t)=i R_{\mathrm{s}}+\frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} .
$$


Substitute $i=d q / d t$ and $E(t)=E(0)+v t$. If we take the common case $E(0)=0$ (your derivation), then $E(t)=v t$ and

$$
v t=R_{\mathrm{s}} \frac{d q}{d t}+\frac{q}{C_{\mathrm{d}}} .
$$


Divide through by $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ to put it in standard first-order linear form:

$$
\frac{d q}{d t}+\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}} q=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} t .
$$


Define the RC time constant

$$
\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}} .
$$


Then the ODE is

$$
\frac{d q}{d t}+\frac{1}{\tau} q=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} t .
$$



The integrating factor is

$$
\mu(t)=e^{\int(1 / \tau) d t}=e^{t / \tau}
$$


Multiply the ODE by $e^{t / \tau}$ :

$$
e^{t / \tau} \frac{d q}{d t}+\frac{1}{\tau} e^{t / \tau} q=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} t e^{t / \tau} .
$$


Recognize the left-hand side as a product derivative:

$$
\frac{d}{d t}\left(e^{t / \tau} q\right)=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} t e^{t / \tau}
$$


Integrate from 0 to $t$. With the usual initial condition for a ramp started from rest, $q(0)=0$,

$$
e^{t / \tau} q(t)-e^0 q(0)=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} \int_0^t t^{\prime} e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime} \quad \Rightarrow \quad e^{t / \tau} q(t)=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}} \int_0^t t^{\prime} e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime}
$$


Evaluate the integral (Derivation Mode: integration by parts)
Let

$$
u=t^{\prime}, \quad d v=e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime}
$$


Then

$$
d u=d t^{\prime}, \quad v=\int e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime}=\tau e^{t^{\prime} / \tau}
$$


So

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_0^t t^{\prime} e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime} & =\left[t^{\prime} \tau e^{t^{\prime} / \tau}\right]_0^t-\int_0^t \tau e^{t^{\prime} / \tau} d t^{\prime} \\
& =\tau t e^{t / \tau}-\tau\left[\tau e^{t^{\prime} / \tau}\right]_0^t \\
& =\tau t e^{t / \tau}-\tau\left(\tau e^{t / \tau}-\tau e^0\right) \\
& =\tau t e^{t / \tau}-\tau\left(\tau e^{t / \tau}-\tau\right) \\
& =\tau t e^{t / \tau}-\tau^2 e^{t / \tau}+\tau^2
\end{aligned}
$$


Substitute back:

$$
e^{t / \tau} q(t)=\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\left(\tau t e^{t / \tau}-\tau^2 e^{t / \tau}+\tau^2\right) .
$$


Divide through by $e^{t / \tau}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
q(t) & =\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\left(\tau t-\tau^2+\tau^2 e^{-t / \tau}\right) \\
& =\frac{v}{R_{\mathrm{s}}}\left(\tau t-\tau^2\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


Now use $\tau / R_{\mathrm{s}}=C_{\mathrm{d}}$ (since $\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$ ):

> [!equation] Voltage-ramp stored charge
> 
> $$
> q(t)=v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(t-\tau\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)\right)
> $$
> 



differentiating the stored charge term-by-term, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
i(t)=\frac{d q}{d t} & =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(\frac{d}{d t} t-\tau \frac{d}{d t}\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)\right) \\
& =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-\tau\left(0-\frac{d}{d t} e^{-t / \tau}\right)\right) \\
& =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-\tau\left(-e^{-t / \tau} \cdot \frac{d}{d t}\left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right)\right)\right) \\
& =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-\tau\left(-e^{-t / \tau} \cdot\left(-\frac{1}{\tau}\right)\right)\right) \\
& =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-\tau\left(\frac{1}{\tau} e^{-t / \tau}\right)\right) \\
& =v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


So the charging current is:

> [!equation] Voltage-ramp charging current (non-faradaic, $R_{\mathrm{s}}$–$C_{\mathrm{d}}$ model)
> $$
> i(t)=vC_{\mathrm{d}}\!\left(1-e^{-t/(R_{\mathrm{s}}C_{\mathrm{d}})}\right)
> $$


From

$$
i(t)=v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)
$$

the current starts at 


$$i\left(0^{+}\right)=v C_{\mathrm{d}}(1-1)=0$$


It rises monotonically with an exponential approach to the plateau. It approaches the long-time limit at:

$$
\lim _{t \rightarrow \infty} i(t)=v C_{\mathrm{d}} .
$$


The current at $t = \tau$ is:


$$i(\tau)=v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-1}\right) \approx 0.63 v C_{\mathrm{d}}$$


So the ramp response is an exponential rise from 0 to the steady "capacitive plateau" $v C_{\mathrm{d}}$, with characteristic time $\tau=R_{\mathrm{s}} C_{\mathrm{d}}$.



**Effect of increasing scan rate $v$ (holding $R_{\mathrm{s}}, C_{\mathrm{d}}$ fixed):**

With $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ fixed, $\tau$ is fixed, and

$$
i(t)=v C_{\mathrm{d}}\left(1-e^{-t / \tau}\right)
$$

shows that increasing $v$ simply scales the current upward linearly at every time $t$. In particular, the plateau scales as

$$
i(\infty)=v C_{\mathrm{d}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad i(\infty) \propto v .
$$


For larger $v$, the $i(t)$ curve has the same shape in time (same $\tau$ ) but rises to a proportionally larger plateau.




> [!figure]
> ![[Pasted image 20260228121828.png|500]]



**Determining $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ from a family of ramps at different scan rates**

At sufficiently long times during the ramp (after the transient has died out, i.e. for $t \gg \tau$ ), the current is approximately at its plateau:

$$
i(t) \approx v C_{\mathrm{d}}
$$


So if you run multiple ramps with different scan rates $v$ and measure the corresponding steady ramp currents $i_{\text {plateau }}$

$$
i_{\text {plateau }}=v C_{\mathrm{d}} .
$$


Therefore, plotting $i_{\text {plateau }}$ versus $v$ yields a straight line with slope $C_{\mathrm{d}}$ :

$$
C_{\mathrm{d}}=\frac{d i_{\text {plateau }}}{d v}
$$


Equivalently, using two experiments $\left(v_1, i_1\right)$ and $\left(v_2, i_2\right)$ in the plateau regime,

$$
C_{\mathrm{d}}=\frac{i_2-i_1}{v_2-v_1} .
$$


This method is especially clean in a non-faradaic window because the measured current is dominated by charging and scales directly with $v$.
