# 1.6e Electron-Transfer Mechanisms; Electrochemical vs Chemical Reversibility (February 11, 2026)

Electron-transfer reactions at electrodes are not all alike. Some proceed without forming (or requiring) a specific bond between the redox species and the electrode surface; others involve adsorbed intermediates and surface-specific chemistry. In addition, the word “reversible” in electrochemistry is used in more than one sense. One can ask whether the electron-transfer step is fast enough to maintain Nernstian equilibrium at the interface (an electrochemical-kinetic question), and one can ask whether the overall chemistry is reversible on the experimental time scale (a chemical-kinetic question). This section distinguishes these ideas and connects them to how voltammetric data should be interpreted.

## 1.6e.1 Two classes of electron-transfer mechanism

> [!Questions] Questions: Outer-sphere versus inner-sphere electron transfer
> 1. What feature distinguishes an outer-sphere electron-transfer step from an inner-sphere step at an electrode?
> 2. Why can an inner-sphere process show strong dependence on electrode material even when the formal redox couple is the “same” in solution?
> 3. In practical voltammetry, what qualitative observation might suggest adsorption or a surface-bound intermediate is involved?

> [!definition] outer-sphere electron transfer
> An ==outer-sphere electron transfer== is an electron-transfer process that does not require formation of a specific chemical bond between the redox species and the electrode surface; the electron is transferred through the interfacial region without a surface-bound intermediate.

> [!definition] inner-sphere electron transfer
> An ==inner-sphere electron transfer== is an electron-transfer process that involves a specifically adsorbed intermediate or bond-forming interaction with the electrode (or a bridging ligand), so that details of the electrode material and surface chemistry can strongly influence the reaction pathway.

The mechanistic distinction can be expressed operationally: an outer-sphere couple is often treated as having a standard potential $E^{0}$ that is (to first approximation) independent of electrode material, while an inner-sphere process can exhibit strong dependence on the electrode because the surface participates directly through adsorption or intermediate formation (for example, hydrogen evolution pathways that involve adsorbed hydrogen).

In practice, “electrode dependence” can show up both thermodynamically (an apparent shift in where a feature occurs on the potential axis) and kinetically (a change in how rapidly the system can respond to the applied potential). This motivates separating a thermodynamic definition of equilibrium potential from the time-scale question of what an experiment actually reveals.

## 1.6e.2 Two meanings of reversibility in electrochemistry

> [!Questions] Questions: Electrochemical versus chemical reversibility
> 1. What does “electrochemically reversible” mean at the level of the interface, and what does it not guarantee about bulk (homogeneous) chemistry?
> 2. What is meant by “chemically reversible” in a cyclic voltammetry experiment, and how is it related to regeneration of the starting redox forms on the reverse scan?
> 3. Why does changing scan rate change whether a coupled chemical step is “visible” in a voltammogram?

The term “reversible” is used in two common (and distinct) senses.

> [!definition] electrochemical reversibility
> ==electrochemical reversibility== is the condition that the electron-transfer step at the electrode is fast enough, relative to the experimental time scale, to maintain near-equilibrium (Nernstian) behavior at the interface.

> [!definition] chemical reversibility
> ==chemical reversibility== is the condition that any coupled homogeneous chemistry (before, after, or concurrent with electron transfer) does not prevent regeneration of the original redox forms on the experimental time scale (for example, on the reverse scan in cyclic voltammetry).

> [!equation] Nernst equation (activity ratio for $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{R}$)
> $$
> E = E^{0} + \frac{RT}{nF}\ln\!\left(\frac{a_{\mathrm{O}}}{a_{\mathrm{R}}}\right)
> $$

This equation says that, when the interface is at (near) equilibrium, the electrode potential is fixed by the interfacial activity ratio $a_{\mathrm{O}}/a_{\mathrm{R}}$ (not by bulk composition). Electrochemical reversibility is the kinetic statement that the electron-transfer step is fast enough for this Nernstian constraint to hold during the experiment.

An electrode process can be electrochemically reversible but chemically irreversible. For example, an electron transfer may be fast enough to be Nernstian at the interface, but the product may undergo an essentially irreversible chemical follow-up reaction in solution, preventing the original redox pair from being regenerated when the scan is reversed.

Conversely, even if the overall chemistry is in principle reversible, an experiment can fail to show reversible behavior if it is conducted on a time scale that is too short (or too long) relative to the relevant kinetics. The key experimental lever is the **scan rate**: changing $v=dE/dt$ changes the time available for a coupled reaction to occur at a given potential window.

> [!equation] Scan rate and linear ramp
> $$
> v=\frac{dE}{dt}
> $$
> 
> $$
> E(t)=E(t_1)+v(t-t_1)
> $$

This equation says that scan rate $v$ is the time-scale dial for a linear potential ramp: increasing $v$ compresses how long the system spends in a given potential window. In cyclic voltammetry, a faster scan can “outrun” a coupled chemical step, while a slower scan gives that chemistry time to proceed and change what species are available on the reverse scan.

> 1. Sketch axes of current $i$ versus potential $E$, and draw a qualitative cyclic voltammogram for a one-electron couple that is electrochemically reversible and chemically reversible (show both forward and reverse peaks).
> 2. On the same axes, sketch a qualitative cyclic voltammogram for a couple that is electrochemically reversible but chemically irreversible due to a fast follow-up reaction of the product (show how the reverse peak changes). Indicate the scan direction on each branch with arrows.

## 1.6e.3 Classifying “reversible” behavior from voltammetry (conceptual exercise)

> [!Questions] Questions: Diagnosing “reversible” behavior in cyclic voltammetry
> 1. In a cyclic voltammogram, what qualitative features suggest that the interfacial couple remains close to Nernstian equilibrium during the scan?
> 2. What voltammetric change would you expect if the product of electron transfer is rapidly consumed by a coupled homogeneous reaction?
> 3. How can you use scan rate as an experimental lever to distinguish a slow electron-transfer step from a coupled chemical step?

The ideas above are repeatedly used when interpreting voltammetric data: one asks which step is rate-limiting (electron transfer vs mass transport vs homogeneous chemistry), and one asks whether the experiment is probing the forward and backward directions under comparable conditions.

> [!exercise] Exercise 1: Distinguishing electrochemical and chemical reversibility
> In the context of voltammetric experiments, explain the difference between **electrochemical reversibility** and **chemical reversibility**.
> 
> Then describe (qualitatively) how increasing the scan rate can change whether a coupled chemical reaction appears “reversible” or “irreversible” in a voltammogram.

**Solution (Exercise 1).** Electrochemical reversibility refers to whether the interfacial electron-transfer step is fast enough to maintain near-equilibrium at the electrode surface. When this holds, the surface concentrations (or activities) of $\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{R}$ adjust quickly enough that the potential follows a Nernstian dependence on the surface ratio. Chemical reversibility refers to whether the chemical forms involved in the redox couple can be regenerated on the experimental time scale, including any coupled homogeneous reactions that consume products or create new species.

Increasing scan rate decreases the time spent at each potential. If a coupled chemical reaction that would otherwise remove a product is slow on the shortened time scale, the voltammogram can appear more “reversible” because the product survives long enough to be converted back during the reverse scan. Conversely, at slow scan rates, even moderately fast coupled chemistry can proceed extensively, leading to an apparently irreversible response even if the electron-transfer step itself is fast.

> [!Lessons] Lessons Learned: What “reversible” means in practice
> **Lesson 1:** “Reversible” can mean either (i) Nernstian electron transfer at the interface (electrochemical reversibility) or (ii) regeneration of chemical forms on the measurement time scale (chemical reversibility); the two should not be conflated.
> 
> **Lesson 2:** Scan rate is a time-scale dial: increasing $v$ compresses the time available for coupled chemical steps, which can make a chemically irreversible process look more reversible in a voltammogram.
