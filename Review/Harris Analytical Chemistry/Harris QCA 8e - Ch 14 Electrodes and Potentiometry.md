Sam Kounaves and his students at Tufts University had the thrill of a lifetime in 2008 when their Wet Chemistry Laboratory on the Phoenix Mars Lander began sending back data on soil scooped up near the north pole of Mars. The objective was to learn the chemical composition of salts that could be leached from the soil by stirring it with water. Measurements of dissolved salts were made by 23 electrochemical sensors, of which 15 were ion-selective electrodes similar to those discussed in this chapter. Sensors were embedded in the walls of four $40-\mathrm{mL}$ epoxy plastic "beakers" used for the leaching experiments. ${ }^{1}$

The temperature on Mars is well below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so each operation began by using precious electric power for up to 90 min to melt an aqueous solution. A $25-\mathrm{mL}$ solution containing $10^{-5} \mathrm{M}$ ionic standards was added to the beaker and sensor responses were monitored for 15 min to obtain a first calibration point for each sensor. A crucible containing known masses of solid salts was then dropped into the beaker and the contents dissolved by stirring. Sensors were monitored for 30 min to obtain a second calibration point.

Earlier, the robotic arm scooped up soil and dumped it through a sieve to reject particles larger than 2 mm . Soil particles fell into a $1-\mathrm{mL}$ drawer, which was later retracted to drop the soil into the leaching solution in the beaker. Each day, scientists on Earth wrote a series of commands to be carried out by the robotic arm. On the next day, photos transmitted by the Lander showed what the arm did and what the soil looked like. From the photos, scientists would plan commands for the following day.

Sensor response was monitored for 200 min while salts from the soil dissolved. The mixture was allowed to freeze during the Martian night and was thawed and measured the next day to observe changes induced by the freeze-thaw cycle. Then 4 mg of 2-nitrobenzoic acid were added to see what changes would be induced by weak acidification for 90 min . Finally, the solution was titrated by three additions of solid $\mathrm{BaCl}_{2}$ to measure $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ by precipitating $\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}$. Even on Mars in 2008, a precipitation titration has its place.

The sequence of operations measured $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}, \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}, \mathrm{I}^{-}$, and pH with ion-selective electrodes. Other electrodes measured conductivity, reduction potential, redox couples, and reducible metals including $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}, \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$. The biggest discovery was a completely unexpected, high concentration of $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$sensed by the nitrate electrode (Box 14-3). A second surprise was that sulfate was not observed.

$\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{l}}$lever chemists have designed electrodes that respond selectively to specific analytes in solution or in the gas phase. Typical ion-selective electrodes are about the size of your pen. Really clever chemists created ion-sensing field effect transistors that are just hundreds of micrometers in size and can be inserted into a blood vessel. The use of electrodes to measure voltages that provide chemical information is called potentiometry.

In the simplest case, analyte is an electroactive species that is part of a galvanic cell. An electroactive species is one that can donate or accept electrons at an electrode. We turn the unknown solution into a half-cell by inserting an electrode, such as a Pt wire, that can transfer electrons to or from the analyte. Because this electrode responds to analyte, it is called the indicator electrode. We connect this half-cell to a second half-cell by a salt bridge. The second half-cell has a fixed composition, so it has a constant potential. Because of its constant potential, the second half-cell is called a reference electrode. The cell voltage is the difference between the variable potential of the analyte half-cell and the constant potential of the reference electrode.

## 14-1 Reference Electrodes

Suppose you want to measure the relative amounts of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in a solution. You can make this solution part of a galvanic cell by inserting a Pt wire and connecting the cell to a constant-potential half-cell by a salt bridge, as shown in Figure 14-1.

The two half-reactions (written as reductions) are
Right electrode:

$$
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}
$$

$E_{+}^{\circ}=0.771 \mathrm{~V}$
Left electrode:

$$
\mathrm{AgCl}(s)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}
$$

The electrode potentials are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E_{+}=0.771-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}\right) \\
& E_{-}=0.222-0.05916 \log \left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

and the cell voltage is the difference $E_{+}-E_{-}$:

$$
E=\left\{0.771-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}\right)\right\}-\left\{0.222-0.05916 \log \left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]\right\}
$$

But [ $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$] in the left half-cell is constant, fixed by the solubility of KCl , with which the solution is saturated. Therefore, the cell voltage changes only when the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$ changes.

FIGURE 14-1 A galvanic cell that can be used to measure the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$ in the right half-cell. The Pt wire is the indicator electrode, and the entire left half-cell plus salt bridge (enclosed by the dashed line) can be considered a reference electrode.

Indicator electrode: responds to analyte activity

Reference electrode: maintains a fixed (reference) potential
$E_{+}$is the potential of the electrode attached to the positive input of the potentiometer. $E_{-}$is the potential of the electrode attached to the negative input of the potentiometer.

The voltage really tells us the quotient of activities, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} / \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}$. We will neglect activity coefficients and write the Nernst equation with concentrations instead of activities.

FIGURE 14-2 Another view of Figure 14-1. The contents of the dashed box in Figure 14-1 are now considered to be a reference electrode dipped into the analyte solution.

The half-cell on the left in Figure 14-1 acts as a reference electrode. We can picture the cell and salt bridge enclosed by the dashed line as a single unit dipped into the analyte solution, as shown in Figure 14-2. The Pt wire is the indicator electrode, whose potential responds to the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$. The reference electrode completes the redox reaction and provides a constant potential to the left side of the potentiometer. Changes in the cell voltage result from changes in the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$.

## Silver-Silver Chloride Reference Electrode ${ }^{\mathbf{2}}$

The half-cell enclosed by the dashed line in Figure 14-1 is called a silver-silver chloride electrode. Figure 14-3 shows how the electrode is reconstructed as a thin tube that can be dipped into analyte solution. Figure 14-4 shows a double-junction electrode that minimizes contact between analyte solution and KCl from the electrode. Silver-silver chloride and calomel reference electrodes (described next) are used because they are convenient. A standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.) is difficult to use because it requires $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas and a freshly prepared catalytic Pt surface that is easily poisoned in many solutions.

FIGURE 14-4 Double-junction reference electrode. The inner electrode is the same as the one in Figure 14-3. The solution in the outer compartment is compatible with analyte solution. For example, if you do not want $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to contact the analyte, the outer electrode can be filled with $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ solution. The inner and outer solutions slowly mix, so the outer compartment must be refilled periodically with fresh $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ solution. [Courtesy Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA.]

The standard reduction potential for the $\mathrm{AgCl} \mid \mathrm{Ag}$ couple is +0.222 V at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This would be the potential of a silver-silver chloride electrode if $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}$were unity. But the activity of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ in a saturated solution of KCl at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is not unity, and the potential of the electrode in Figure 14-3 is +0.197 V with respect to S.H.E. at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/60d08d7b-1e7a-4130-87f8-996c404932a8-03.jpg?height=726&width=439&top_left_y=1713&top_left_x=168)
FIGURE 14-5 A saturated calomel electrode (S.C.E.).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Ag} \mid \operatorname{AgCl} \text { electrode: } & \operatorname{AgCl}(s)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \\
E(\text { saturated } \mathrm{KCl}) & =+0.222 \mathrm{~V} \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$

A problem with reference electrodes is that porous plugs become clogged, thus causing sluggish, unstable electrical response. Some designs incorporate a free-flowing capillary in place of the porous plug. Other designs allow you to force fresh solution from the electrode through the electrode-analyte junction prior to a measurement.

## Calomel Electrode

The calomel electrode in Figure 14-5 is based on the reaction

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\text { Calomel electrode: } & \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(s)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}(l)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} & E^{\circ} & =+0.268 \mathrm{~V} \\
\substack{\text { Mercury(I) chloride } \\
\text { (Calomel) }} & E(\text { saturated } \mathrm{KCl}) & =+0.241 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

The standard potential for this reaction is +0.268 V . If the cell is saturated with KCl at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the potential is +0.241 V . A calomel electrode saturated with KCl is called a saturated calomel electrode, abbreviated S.C.E. The advantage in using saturated KCl is that $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$ does not change if some liquid evaporates.

FIGURE 14-6 A diagram that helps us convert electrode potential between different reference scales.

## Voltage Conversions Between Different Reference Scales

If an electrode has a potential of -0.461 V with respect to a calomel electrode, what is the potential with respect to a silver-silver chloride electrode? What would be the potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode?

To answer these questions, Figure 14-6 shows the positions of the calomel and silver-silver chloride electrodes with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. We see that point A , which is -0.461 V from S.C.E., is -0.417 V from the silver-silver chloride electrode and -0.220 V with respect to S.H.E. Point B, whose potential is +0.033 V from silver-silver chloride, is -0.011 V from S.C.E. and +0.230 V from S.H.E. By keeping this diagram in mind, you can convert potentials from one scale into another.

## 14-2 Indicator Electrodes

We will study two broad classes of indicator electrodes. Metal electrodes described in this section develop an electric potential in response to a redox reaction at the metal surface. Ionselective electrodes described later are not based on redox processes. Instead, selective binding of one type of ion to a membrane generates an electric potential.

The most common metal indicator electrode is platinum, which is relatively inert-it does not participate in many chemical reactions. Its purpose is simply to transmit electrons to or from species in solution. Gold electrodes are even more inert than Pt. Various types of carbon are used as indicator electrodes because the rates of many redox reactions on the carbon surface are fast. A metal electrode works best when its surface is large and clean. To clean the electrode, dip it in hot $8 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ in a fume hood and rinse with distilled water.

Figure 14-7 shows how a silver electrode can be used with a reference electrode to measure $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$concentration. ${ }^{3}$ The reaction at the Ag indicator electrode is

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s) \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=0.799 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The calomel reference half-cell reaction is

$$
\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Hg}(l)+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \quad E_{-}=0.241 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The reference potential ( $E_{-}$, not $E_{-}^{\circ}$ ) is fixed at 0.241 V because the reference cell is saturated with KCl . The Nernst equation for the entire cell is therefore

$$
\begin{gathered}
E=E_{+}-E_{-}=\underbrace{\left\{0.799-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]}\right)\right\}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Potential of } \mathrm{Ag} \mid \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \\
\text {indicator electrode }
\end{array}}-\{\overbrace{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Potential of } \\
\text { S.C.E. reference electrode }
\end{array}}^{0.241\}} \\
E=0.558+0.05916 \log \left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]
\end{gathered}
$$

FIGURE 14-7 Use of Ag and calomel electrodes to measure $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$. The calomel electrode has a double junction, like that in Figure 14-4. The outer compartment of the electrode is filled with $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$, so there is no direct contact between $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in the inner compartment and $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$in the beaker.

That is, the voltage of the cell in Figure 14-7 provides a measure of $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$. Ideally, the voltage changes by 59.16 mV (at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) for each factor-of-10 change in $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$.

## EXAMPLE Potentiometric Precipitation Titration

A $100.0-\mathrm{mL}$ solution containing 0.1000 M NaCl was titrated with $0.1000 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$, and the voltage of the cell shown in Figure 14-7 was monitored. The equivalence volume is $V_{\mathrm{e}}=100.0 \mathrm{~mL}$. Calculate the voltage after the addition of (a) 65.0 and (b) 135.0 mL of $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$.

Solution The titration reaction is

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(s)
$$

(a) At $65.0 \mathrm{~mL}, 65.0 \%$ of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$has precipitated and $35.0 \%$ remains in solution:

$$
\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]=\underbrace{(0.350)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Fraction } \\
\text { remaining }
\end{array}} \underbrace{(0.1000 \mathrm{M})}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Original } \\
\text { concentration } \\
\text { of } \mathrm{Cl}^{-}
\end{array}} \underbrace{\left(\frac{100.0}{165.0}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Dilution } \\
\text { factor }
\end{array}}=0.0212 \mathrm{M}
$$

To find the cell voltage in Equation 14-1, we need to know $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$:

$$
\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]=K_{\mathrm{sp}} \Rightarrow\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]=\frac{K_{\mathrm{sp}}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]}=\frac{1.8 \times 10^{-10}}{0.0212 \mathrm{M}}=8.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}
$$

The cell voltage is therefore

$$
E=0.558+0.05916 \log \left(8.5 \times 10^{-9}\right)=0.081 \mathrm{~V}
$$

(b) At 135.0 mL , there is an excess of 35.0 mL of $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}=3.50 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$in a total volume of 235.0 mL . Therefore, $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]=(3.50 \mathrm{mmol}) /(235.0 \mathrm{~mL})=0.0149 \mathrm{M}$. The cell voltage is

$$
E=0.558+0.05916 \log (0.0149)=0.450 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Test Yourself Find the voltage after addition of 99.0 mL of $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$. (Answer: 0.177 V )

FIGURE 14-8 Titration curve computed for the addition of $0.1000 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$to 100.0 mL of $0.1000 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$with the electrodes in Figure 14-7. Points computed at 65.0 and 135.0 mL are shown. Colored line is pAg $=-\log \left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$.

The cell responds to a change in $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, which necessarily changes $\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]$because

## DEMONSTRATION 14-1 Potentiometry with an Oscillating Reaction ${ }^{5}$

The Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction is a cerium-catalyzed oxidation of malonic acid by bromate, in which the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right]$ oscillates by a factor of 10 to $100 .^{6}$

$$
\underset{\text { Malonic acid }}{3 \mathrm{CH}_{2}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right)_{2}}+\underset{\text { Bromate }}{2 \mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow
$$

$$
2 \mathrm{BrCH}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right)_{2}+3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Bromomalonic acid
When the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ concentration is high, the solution is yellow. When $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ predominates, the solution is colorless. With redox indicators (Section 15-2), this reaction oscillates through a sequence of colors. ${ }^{7}$

Oscillation between yellow and colorless is set up in a $300-\mathrm{mL}$ beaker with the following solutions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 160 \mathrm{~mL} \text { of } 1.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \\
& 40 \mathrm{~mL} \text { of } 2 \mathrm{M} \text { malonic acid } \\
& 30 \mathrm{~mL} \text { of } 0.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaBrO} 3 \text { (or saturated } \mathrm{KBrO}_{3} \text { ) } \\
& 4 \mathrm{~mL} \text { of saturated ceric ammonium sulfate, } \\
& \left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{2} \cdot 2\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

After an induction period of 5 to 10 min with magnetic stirring, oscillations can be initiated by adding 1 mL of ceric ammonium sulfate solution. The reaction may need more $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ over a 5 -min period to initiate oscillations.

A galvanic cell is built around the reaction as shown in the figure. The quotient $\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right]$ is monitored by Pt and calomel electrodes. You should be able to write the cell reactions and a Nernst equation for this experiment.

Apparatus used to monitor the quotient $\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right]$ for an oscillating reaction. [The idea for this demonstration came from George Rossman, California Institute of Technology.]

In place of a potentiometer (a pH meter), use a computer or recorder to show the oscillations. Because the potential oscillates over a range of $\sim 100 \mathrm{mV}$ but is centered near $\sim 1.2 \mathrm{~V}$, the cell voltage is offset by $\sim 1.2 \mathrm{~V}$ with any available power supply. ${ }^{8}$ Trace $a$ shows what is usually observed. The potential changes rapidly during the abrupt colorless-to-yellow change and gradually during the gentle yellow-to-colorless change. Trace $b$ shows two different cycles superimposed in the same solution. This unusual event occurred in a reaction that had been oscillating normally for about $30 \mathrm{~min} .^{9}$

## 14-3 What Is a Junction Potential?

Whenever dissimilar electrolyte solutions are in contact, a voltage difference called the junction potential develops at their interface. This small voltage (usually a few millivolts) is found at each end of a salt bridge connecting two half-cells. The junction potential puts a fundamental limitation on the accuracy of direct potentiometric measurements, because we usually do not know the contribution of the junction to the measured voltage.

$$
E_{\text {observed }}=E_{\text {cell }}+E_{\text {junction }}
$$

Because the junction potential is usually unknown, $E_{\text {cell }}$ is uncertain.

a. The mobility of an ion is the terminal velocity that the particle achieves in an electric field of $1 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{m}$. Mobility $=$ velocity/field. The units of mobility are therefore $(m / s) /(V / m)=m^{2} /(s \cdot V)$.

To see why the junction potential occurs, consider a solution of NaCl in contact with distilled water (Figure 14-9). $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions begin to diffuse from the NaCl solution into the water. However, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion has a greater mobility than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. That is, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$diffuses faster than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. As a result, a region rich in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, with excess negative charge, develops at the front. Behind it is a positively charged region depleted of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The result is an electric potential difference at the junction of the NaCl and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ phases. The junction potential opposes the movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and accelerates the movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The steady-state junction potential represents a balance between the unequal mobilities that create a charge imbalance and the tendency of the resulting charge imbalance to retard the movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

Table 14-1 shows mobilities of several ions and Table 14-2 lists some liquid junction potentials. Saturated KCl is used in a salt bridge because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$have similar mobilities. Junction potentials at the two interfaces of a KCl salt bridge are slight.

Nonetheless, the junction potential of $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl} \mid 3.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KCl}$ is 3.1 mV . A pH electrode has a response of 59 mV per pH unit. A pH electrode dipped into 0.1 M HCl will have a junction potential of $\sim 3 \mathrm{mV}$, or an error of 0.05 pH units ( $12 \%$ error in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$).

## EXAMPLE Junction Potential

A 0.1 M NaCl solution was placed in contact with a $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ solution. Which side of the junction is positive?

Solution Because [ $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$] is equal on both sides, there is no net diffusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the junction. However, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$diffuses into $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$diffuses into NaCl . The mobility of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is greater than that of $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$, so the NaCl region will be depleted of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$faster than the $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ region will be depleted of $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$. The $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ side will become negative, and the NaCl side will become positive.

Test Yourself Which side of the $0.05 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl} \mid 0.05 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{LiCl}$ junction will be positive? (Answer: LiCl)

## 14-4 How lon-Selective Electrodes Work ${ }^{10}$

Ion-selective electrodes discussed in the remainder of this chapter respond selectively to one ion. These electrodes are fundamentally different from metal electrodes in that ion-selective electrodes do not involve redox processes. The key feature of an ideal ion-selective electrode is a thin membrane capable of binding only the intended ion.

Consider the liquid-based ion-selective electrode in Figure 14-10a. The electrode is said to be "liquid based" because the ion-selective membrane is a hydrophobic organic polymer impregnated with a viscous organic solution containing an ion exchanger and, sometimes, a ligand that selectively binds the analyte cation, $\mathrm{C}^{+}$. The inside of the electrode contains filling solution with the ions $\mathrm{C}^{+}(a q)$ and $\mathrm{B}^{-}(a q)$. The outside of the electrode is immersed in analyte solution containing $\mathrm{C}^{+}(a q), \mathrm{A}^{-}(a q)$, and, perhaps, other ions. Ideally, it does not matter what $\mathrm{A}^{-}$and $\mathrm{B}^{-}$and the other ions are. The electric potential difference (the voltage) across the ion-selective membrane is measured by two reference electrodes, which might be $\mathrm{Ag} \mid \mathrm{AgCl}$. If the concentration (really, the activity) of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the analyte solution changes, the voltage measured between the two reference electrodes also changes. By using a calibration curve, the voltage tells us the activity of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the analyte solution.

FIGURE 14-10 (a) lon-selective electrode immersed in aqueous solution containing analyte cation, $\mathrm{C}^{+}$. Typically, the membrane is made of poly(vinyl chloride) impregnated with the plasticizer dioctyl sebacate, a nonpolar liquid that softens the membrane and dissolves the ion-selective ionophore (L), the complex ( $\mathrm{LC}^{+}$), and a hydrophobic anion ( $\mathrm{R}^{-}$).
(b) Close-up of membrane. Ellipses encircling pairs of ions are a guide for the eye to count the charge in each phase. Bold colored ions represent excess charge in each phase. The electric potential difference across each surface of the membrane depends on the activity of analyte ion in the aqueous solution contacting the membrane.

Figure 14-10b shows how the electrode works. The key in this example is the ligand, L (called an ionophore), which is soluble inside the membrane and selectively binds analyte ion. In a potassium ion-selective electrode, for example, L could be valinomycin, a natural antibiotic secreted by certain microorganisms to carry $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion across cell membranes. The ligand, $L$, is chosen to have a high affinity for analyte cation, $C^{+}$, and low affinity for other ions. In an ideal electrode, L binds only $\mathrm{C}^{+}$. Real electrodes always have some affinity for other cations, so these cations interfere to some degree with the measurement of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$. For charge neutrality, the membrane also contains a hydrophobic anion, $\mathrm{R}^{-}$, such as tetraphenylborate, $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~B}^{-}$, that is soluble in the membrane and poorly soluble in water.

Almost all analyte ion inside the membrane in Figure 14-10b is bound in the complex $\mathrm{LC}^{+}$, which is in equilibrium with a small amount of free $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the membrane. The membrane also contains excess free $\mathrm{L} . \mathrm{C}^{+}$can diffuse across the interface. In an ideal electrode, $\mathrm{R}^{-}$cannot leave the membrane, because it is not soluble in water, and the aqueous anion $\mathrm{A}^{-}$ cannot enter the membrane, because it is not soluble in the organic phase. As soon as a few $\mathrm{C}^{+}$ions diffuse from the membrane into the aqueous phase, there is excess positive charge in the aqueous phase. This imbalance creates an electric potential difference that opposes diffusion of more $\mathrm{C}^{+}$into the aqueous phase. The region of charge imbalance extends just a few nanometers into the membrane and into the neighboring solution.

When $\mathrm{C}^{+}$diffuses from a region of activity $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}$ in the membrane to a region of activity $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}$ in the outer solution, the free energy change is

$$
\Delta G=\underbrace{\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\Delta G \text { due to change } \\
\text { in solvent }
\end{array}}-\underbrace{R T \ln \left(\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\Delta G \text { due to } \\
\text { change in activity } \\
\text { (concentration) }
\end{array}}
$$

Valinomycin- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$complex has six carbonyl oxygen atoms in octahedral coordination around $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. [From L. Stryer, Biochemistry, 4th ed. (New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1995), p. 273.]

L has some ability to bind other ions besides $\mathrm{C}^{+}$, so those other ions interfere to some extent with the measurement of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$. An ionselective electrode uses a ligand with a strong preference to bind the desired ion.

Tetraphenylborate, $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~B}^{-}$
where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is temperature (K). $\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}$ is the change in solvation energy when the environment around $\mathrm{C}^{+}$changes from the organic liquid in the membrane to the aqueous solution outside the membrane. The term $-R T \ln \left(\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}} / \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ gives the free energy change when a species diffuses between regions of different activities (concentrations). In the absence of a phase boundary, $\Delta G$ would always be negative when a species diffuses from a region of high activity to one of lower activity.

The driving force for diffusion of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$from the membrane to the aqueous solution is the favorable solvation of the ion by water. As $\mathrm{C}^{+}$diffuses from the membrane into the water, there is a buildup of positive charge in the water immediately adjacent to the membrane. The charge separation creates an electric potential difference ( $E_{\text {outer }}$ ) across the membrane. The free energy difference for $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the two phases is $\Delta G=-n F E_{\text {outer }}$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant and $n$ is the charge of the ion. At equilibrium, the net change in free energy for diffusion of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$across the membrane boundary must be 0 :

$$
\underbrace{\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}-R T \ln \left(\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\Delta G \text { due to transfer between phases } \\
\text { and activity difference }
\end{array}}+\underbrace{\left(-n F E_{\text {outer }}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\Delta G \text { due to } \\
\text { charge imbalance }
\end{array}}=0
$$

Solving for $E_{\text {outer }}$, we find that the electric potential difference across the boundary between the membrane and the outer aqueous solution in Figure 14-10b is

## Electric potential

boundary between

E_{\text {outer }}=\frac{\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}}{n F}-\left(\frac{R T}{n F}\right) \ln \left(\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)
$$

membrane and analyte:
There is also a potential difference $E_{\text {inner }}$ at the boundary between the inner filling solution and the membrane, with terms analogous to those in Equation 14-4.

The potential difference between the outer analyte solution and the inner filling solution is the difference $E=E_{\text {outer }}-E_{\text {inner }}$. In Equation 14-4, $E_{\text {outer }}$ depends on the activities of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$ in the analyte solution and in the membrane near its outer surface. $E_{\text {inner }}$ is constant because the activity of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the filling solution is constant.

But the activity of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the membrane ( $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}$ ) is very nearly constant for the following reason: The high concentration of $\mathrm{LC}^{+}$in the membrane is in equilibrium with free L and a small concentration of free $\mathrm{C}^{+}$in the membrane. The hydrophobic anion $\mathrm{R}^{-}$is poorly soluble in water and therefore cannot leave the membrane. Very little $\mathrm{C}^{+}$can diffuse out of the membrane because each $\mathrm{C}^{+}$that enters the aqueous phase leaves behind one $\mathrm{R}^{-}$in the membrane. (This separation of charge is the source of the potential difference at the phase boundary.) As soon as a tiny fraction of $\mathrm{C}^{+}$diffuses from the membrane into solution, further diffusion is prevented by excess positive charge in the solution near the membrane.

So the potential difference between the outer and the inner solutions is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E=E_{\text {outer }}-E_{\text {inner }}=\frac{\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}}{n F}-\left(\frac{R T}{n F}\right) \ln \left(\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)-E_{\text {inner }} \\
& E=\underbrace{\frac{\Delta G_{\text {solvation }}}{n F}}_{\text {Constant }}+\left(\frac{R T}{n F}\right) \ln \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}-\underbrace{\left(\frac{R T}{n F}\right) \ln \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}_{\text {Constant }}-\underbrace{E_{\text {inner }}}_{\text {Constant }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining the constant terms, we find that the potential difference across the membrane depends only on the activity of analyte in the outer solution:

$$
E=\text { constant }+\left(\frac{R T}{n F}\right) \ln \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}
$$

Converting ln into log and inserting values of $R, T$, and $F$ gives a useful expression for the

Electric potential
difference for
ion-selective electrode: potential difference across the membrane:

$$
E=\text { constant }+\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}\left(\text { volts at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

where $n$ is the charge of the analyte ion and $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}$ is its activity in the outer (unknown) solution. Equation 14-5 applies to any ion-selective electrode, including a glass pH electrode. If the analyte is an anion, the sign of $n$ is negative. Later, we will modify the equation to account for interfering ions.

A difference of 59.16 mV (at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) builds up across a glass pH electrode for every factor-of- 10 change in activity of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the analyte solution. Because a factor-of- 10 difference in activity of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is 1 pH unit, a difference of, say, 4.00 pH units would lead to a potential difference of $4.00 \times 59.16=237 \mathrm{mV}$. The charge of a calcium ion is $n=2$, so a potential difference of $59.16 / 2=29.58 \mathrm{mV}$ is expected for every factor-of-10 change in activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the analyte measured with a calcium ion-selective electrode.

## 14-5 pH Measurement with a Glass Electrode

The glass electrode used to measure pH is the most common ion-selective electrode. A typical pH combination electrode, incorporating both glass and reference electrodes in one body, is shown in Figure 14-11. A line diagram of this cell can be written as follows:

The pH -sensitive part of the electrode is the thin glass bulb or cone at the bottom of the electrodes in Figures 14-11 and 14-12. The reference electrode at the left of the preceding

FIGURE 14-11 Diagram of a glass combination electrode with a silver-silver chloride reference electrode. The glass electrode is immersed in a solution of unknown pH so that the porous plug on the lower right is below the surface of the liquid. The two $\mathrm{Ag} \mid \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrodes measure the voltage across the glass membrane.
M. Cremer at the Institute of Physiology at Munich discovered in 1906 that a potential difference of 0.2 V developed across a glass membrane with acid on one side and neutral saline solution on the other. The student Klemensiewicz, working with F. Haber in Karlsruhe in 1908, improved the glass electrode and carried out the first acid-base titration to be monitored with a glass electrode. ${ }^{11}$

So little current flows across a glass electrode that it was not practical when discovered in 1906. One of the first people to use a vacuum tube amplifier to measure pH with a glass electrode was an undergraduate, W. H. Wright at the University of Illinois in 1928, who knew about electronics from amateur radio. Arnold Beckman at Caltech invented a portable, rugged, vacuum tube pH meter in 1935, a device that revolutionized chemical instrumentation. ${ }^{12}$

The reference electrode at the right side of the line diagram is the straight $\mathrm{Ag} \mid \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrode at the center of the electrode in Figure 14-11. The two reference electrodes measure the electric potential difference across the glass membrane. The salt bridge in the line diagram is the porous plug at the bottom right side of the combination electrode in Figure 14-11.

Figure 14-13 shows the irregular structure of the silicate lattice in glass. Negatively charged oxygen atoms in glass can bind to cations of suitable size. Monovalent cations, particularly $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, can move sluggishly through the silicate lattice. A schematic cross section of the glass membrane of a pH electrode is shown in Figure 14-14. The two surfaces swell as they absorb water. Metal ions in these hydrated gel regions of the membrane diffuse out of the glass and into solution. $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can diffuse into the membrane to replace the metal ions. The reaction in which $\mathrm{H}^{+}$replaces cations in the glass is an ion-exchange equilibrium (Figure 14-15). A pH electrode responds selectively to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is the only ion that binds significantly to the hydrated gel layer.

To perform an electrical measurement, at least some tiny current must flow through the entire circuit-even across the glass pH electrode membrane. Studies with tritium (radioactive ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}$ ) show that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$does not cross the glass membrane. However, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$sluggishly crosses the membrane. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-sensitive membrane may be thought of as two surfaces electrically connected by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport. The membrane's resistance is typically $10^{8} \Omega$, so little current actually flows across it.

The potential difference between the inner and outer silver-silver chloride electrodes in Figure 14-11 depends on the chloride concentration in each electrode compartment and on the potential difference across the glass membrane. Because [ $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$] is fixed in each compartment and because [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] is fixed on the inside of the glass membrane, the only variable is the pH of analyte solution outside the glass membrane. Equation 14-5 states that the voltage of the ideal pH electrode changes by 59.16 mV for every pH -unit change of analyte activity at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The response of real glass electrodes is described by the Nernst-like equation

The value of $\beta$, the electromotive efficiency, is close to 1.00 (typically $>0.98$ ). We measure the constant and $\beta$ when we calibrate the electrode in solutions of known pH .

## Calibrating a Glass Electrode

A pH electrode should be calibrated with two (or more) standard buffers selected so that the pH of the unknown lies within the range of the standards. Standards in Table 14-3 are accurate to $\pm 0.01 \mathrm{pH}$ unit. ${ }^{13}$

When you calibrate an electrode with standard buffers, you measure a voltage with the electrode in each buffer (Figure 14-16). The pH of buffer S 1 is $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}$ and the measured electrode potential in this buffer is $E_{\mathrm{S} 1}$. The pH of buffer S 2 is $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 2}$ and the measured electrode potential is $E_{\mathrm{S} 2}$. The equation of the line through the two standard points is

$$
\frac{E-E_{\mathrm{S} 1}}{\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{S} 2}-E_{\mathrm{S} 1}}{\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 2}-\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}}
$$

The slope of the line is $\Delta E / \Delta \mathrm{pH}=\left(E_{\mathrm{S} 2}-E_{\mathrm{S} 1}\right) /\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 2}-\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}\right)$, which is $59.16 \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for an ideal electrode and $\beta(59.16) \mathrm{mV} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit for a real electrode, where $\beta$ is the correction factor in Equation 14-6.

To measure the pH of an unknown, measure the potential of the unknown with the calibrated electrode and find pH by substitution in Equation 14-7:

$$
\frac{E_{\text {unknown }}-E_{\mathrm{S} 1}}{\mathrm{pH}_{\text {unknown }}-\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}}=\frac{E_{\mathrm{S} 2}-E_{\mathrm{S} 1}}{\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 2}-\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{S} 1}}
$$

Alas, modern pH meters are "black boxes" that do these calculations for us by applying Equations 14-7 and 14-8 and automatically displaying pH .

Before using a pH electrode, be sure that the air inlet near the upper end of the electrode in Figure 14-11 is not capped. (This hole is capped during storage to prevent evaporation of the reference electrode filling solution.) Wash the electrode with distilled water and gently blot it dry with a tissue. Do not wipe it, because this action might produce a static charge on the glass.

To calibrate the electrode, dip it in a standard buffer whose pH is near 7 and allow the electrode to equilibrate with stirring for at least a minute. Following the manufacturer's instructions, press a key that might say "Calibrate" or "Read" on a microprocessor-controlled meter or adjust the reading of an analog meter to indicate the pH of the standard buffer. Then wash the electrode with water, blot it dry, and immerse it in a second standard whose pH is further from 7 than the pH of the first standard. Enter the second buffer on the meter. Finally, dip the electrode in the unknown, stir the liquid, allow the reading to stabilize, and read the pH .

Store a glass electrode in aqueous solution to prevent dehydration of the glass. Ideally, the solution should be similar to that inside the reference compartment of the electrode. If the electrode has dried, recondition it in dilute acid for several hours. If the electrode is to be used above pH 9 , soak it in a high- pH buffer. (The field effect transistor pH electrode in Section 14-8 is stored dry. Prior to use, scrub it gently with a soft brush and soak it in pH 7 buffer for 10 min .)

If electrode response becomes sluggish or if an electrode cannot be calibrated properly, try soaking it in 6 M HCl , followed by water. As a last resort, soak the electrode in $20 \mathrm{wt} \%$ aqueous ammonium bifluoride, $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{HF}_{2}$, for 1 min in a plastic beaker. This reagent dissolves glass and exposes fresh surface. Wash the electrode with water and try calibrating it again. Avoid contact with ammonium bifluoride, which produces a painful HF burn.

## Errors in pH Measurement

1. Standards. A pH measurement cannot be more accurate than our standards, which are typically $\pm 0.01 \mathrm{pH}$ unit.
2. Junction potential. A junction potential exists at the porous plug near the bottom of the electrode in Figure 14-11. If the ionic composition of the analyte solution is different from that of the standard buffer, the junction potential will change even if the pH of the two solutions is the same (Box 14-1, page 322). This effect gives an uncertainty of at least $\sim 0.01 \mathrm{pH}$ unit.
3. Junction potential drift. Most combination electrodes have a $\mathrm{Ag} \mid \mathrm{AgCl}$ reference electrode containing saturated KCl solution. More than 350 mg Ag per liter dissolve in the KCl , mainly as $\mathrm{AgCl}_{4}^{3-}$ and $\mathrm{AgCl}_{3}^{2-}$. In the porous plug, KCl is diluted and AgCl can precipitate. If analyte solution contains a reducing agent, $\operatorname{Ag}(s)$ also can precipitate

A pH electrode must be calibrated before it can be used. It should be calibrated every 2 h during sustained use.

FIGURE 14-16 Two-point calibration of a pH electrode.

Do not leave a glass electrode out of water (or in a nonaqueous solvent) any longer than necessary.

The apparent pH will change if the ionic composition of the analyte changes, even when the actual pH is constant.

Moral: A small uncertainty in voltage $(1.3 \mathrm{mV})$ or $\mathrm{pH}(0.02$ unit) corresponds to a large uncertainty ( $5 \%$ ) in analyte concentration. Similar uncertainties arise in other potentiometric measurements.
in the plug. Both effects change the junction potential, causing a slow drift of the pH reading (solid colored circles in Figure 14-17). You can compensate for this error by recalibrating the electrode every 2 h .
4. Sodium error. When $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is very low and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is high, the electrode responds to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and the apparent pH is lower than the true pH . This is called the sodium error or alkaline error (Figure 14-18).

FIGURE 14-17 Solid colored circles show the drift in apparent pH of a low-conductivity industrial water supply measured continuously by a single electrode. Individual measurements with a freshly calibrated electrode (black circles) demonstrate that the pH is not drifting. Drift is attributed to slow clogging of the electrode's porous plug with $\mathrm{AgCl}(s)$. When a cation-exchange resin was placed inside the reference electrode near the porous plug, $\mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{I})$ was bound by the resin and did not precipitate. This electrode gave the drift-free, continuous reading shown by open diamonds. [From S. Ito, H. Hachiya, K. Baba, Y. Asano, and H .

5. Acid error. In strong acid, the measured pH is higher than the actual pH (Figure 14-18), perhaps because the glass is saturated with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and cannot be further protonated.
6. Equilibration time. It takes time for an electrode to equilibrate with a solution. A wellbuffered solution requires $\sim 30 \mathrm{~s}$ with adequate stirring. A poorly buffered solution (such as one near the equivalence point of a titration) needs many minutes.
7. Hydration of glass. A dry electrode requires several hours of soaking before it responds to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$correctly.
8. Temperature. A pH meter should be calibrated at the same temperature at which the measurement will be made.
9. Cleaning. If an electrode has been exposed to a hydrophobic liquid, such as oil, it should be cleaned with a solvent that will dissolve the liquid and then conditioned well in aqueous solution. The reading of an improperly cleaned electrode can drift for hours while the electrode re-equilibrates with aqueous solution.

Errors 1 and 2 limit the accuracy of pH measurement with the glass electrode to $\pm 0.02 \mathrm{pH}$ unit, at best. Measurement of pH differences between solutions can be accurate to about $\pm 0.002 \mathrm{pH}$ unit, but knowledge of the true pH will still be at least an order of magnitude more uncertain. An uncertainty of $\pm 0.02 \mathrm{pH}$ unit corresponds to an uncertainty of $\pm 5 \%$ in $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.

Acid rain in North America is most severe in the East, downwind of many coal-fired power plants. In the three-year period 1995-1997, after $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ emissions were limited by a new law, concentrations of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in precipitation decreased by $10-25 \%$ in the eastern United States. ${ }^{15}$

Acid rain threatens lakes and forests throughout the world. Monitoring the pH of rainwater is a critical component of programs to measure and reduce the production of acid rain.

To identify systematic errors in the measurement of pH of rainwater, a careful study was conducted with 17 laboratories. ${ }^{16}$ Eight samples were provided to each laboratory, along with instructions on how to conduct the measurements. Each laboratory used two buffers to standardize pH meters. Sixteen laboratories successfully measured the pH of Unknown A (within $\pm 0.02 \mathrm{pH}$ unit), which was 4.008 at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. One lab whose measurement was 0.04 pH unit low had a faulty commercial standard buffer.

(c) pH of rainwater from identical samples measured at 17 different labs using standard buffers for calibration. Letters designate different types of pH electrodes.

Panel (c) shows typical results for the pH of rainwater. The average of the 17 measurements is given by the horizontal line at pH 4.14 , and the letters s, t, u, v, w, x, y, and z identify types of pH electrodes. Types s and w had relatively large systematic errors. The type s electrode was a combination electrode (Figure 14-11) containing a reference electrode liquid junction with an exceptionally large area. Electrode type w had a reference electrode filled with a gel.

A hypothesis was that variations in the liquid junction potential (Section 14-3) led to variations among the pH measurements. Standard buffers have ionic strengths of 0.05 to 0.1 M , whereas rainwater samples have ionic strengths two or more orders of magnitude lower. To see whether junction potential caused systematic errors, $2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HCl}$ was used as a pH standard in place of high ionic strength buffers. Panel (d) shows good results from all but the first lab. The standard deviation of 17 measurements was reduced from 0.077 pH unit (with standard buffer) to 0.029 pH unit (with HCl standard). It was concluded that junction potential caused most of the variability between labs and that a low ionic strength standard is appropriate for rainwater pH measurements. ${ }^{17,18}$

## Not All pH Electrodes Are Glass

Glass electrodes are the most common, but not the only means, for measuring pH . Solid-state pH electrodes based on the field effect transistor are described at the end of this chapter. Liquid-based ion-selective electrodes for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$are described in Section 14-6.

An anhydrous $\mathrm{IrO}_{2}$ layer formed by oxidation of iridium wire responds to pH by a halfreaction that might be ${ }^{20}$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{IrO}_{2}(s)+\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \operatorname{IrOOH}(s) \\
E=E^{\circ}-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}\right)=E^{\circ}-0.05916 \mathrm{pH}
\end{gathered}
$$

Other metal oxide electrodes have been used under extreme conditions. For example, a $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}$ electrode can measure pH up to $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C} .^{21}$

The Phoenix Mars Lander described at the opening of this chapter had two liquid-based ion-selective electrodes in each Wet Chemistry Lab to measure the pH of Martian soil suspended in water. It was not certain that these electrodes would survive the temperatures and pressures encountered during the mission, so a rugged $\mathrm{IrO}_{2} \mathrm{pH}$ electrode was added. The $\mathrm{IrO}_{2}$ electrode remains accurate at $\mathrm{pH}>9$, a condition at which ion-selective electrodes were nonresponsive.

## 14-6 Ion-Selective Electrodes ${ }^{22,23}$

A critically ill patient is wheeled into the emergency room, and the doctor needs blood chemistry information quickly to help her make a diagnosis. Analytes in Table 14-4 are part of the critical care profile of blood chemistry. Every analyte in the table can be measured by electrochemical means. Ion-selective electrodes are the method of choice for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{pH}$, and $P_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The "Chem 7" test constitutes up to 70\% of tests performed in the hospital lab. It measures $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, glucose, urea, and creatinine, four of which are analyzed with ion-selective electrodes.

Most ion-selective electrodes fall into one of the following classes:

1. Glass membranes for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and certain monovalent cations
2. Solid-state electrodes based on inorganic crystals or, recently, conductive polymers
3. Liquid-based electrodes using a hydrophobic polymer membrane saturated with a hydrophobic liquid ion exchanger
4. Compound electrodes with an analyte-selective electrode enclosed by a membrane that separates analyte from other species or that generates analyte in a chemical reaction.

## Reminder: How Ion-Selective Electrodes Work

In Figure 14-10, analyte ions equilibrate with ion-exchange sites at the outer surface of the ion-selective membrane. Diffusion of analyte ions out of the membrane creates a slight charge imbalance (an electric potential difference) across the interface between the membrane and the analyte solution. Changes in analyte ion concentration in the solution change the potential difference across the outer boundary of the ion-selective membrane. A calibration curve relates the potential difference to analyte concentration.

An ion-selective electrode responds to the activity of free analyte, not complexed analyte. For example, when $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ in tap water at pH 8 was measured with an ion-selective electrode, the result was $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]=2 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$. ${ }^{24}$ When lead in the same tap water was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Section 20-6), the result was more than 10 times greater: $3 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}$. The discrepancy arose because the inductively coupled plasma measures all lead and the ion-selective electrode measures free $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. In tap water at pH 8 , much of the lead is complexed by $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}$, and other anions. When the pH of tap water was adjusted to $4, \mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}$ dissociated from its complexes and the concentration indicated by the ion-selective electrode was $3 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}$-the same value found by inductively coupled plasma.

## Selectivity Coefficient

No electrode responds exclusively to one kind of ion, but the glass pH electrode is among the most selective. Sodium ion is the principal interfering species. Its effect on the pH reading is only significant when $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \lesssim 10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right] \gtrsim 10^{-2} \mathrm{M}$ (Figure 14-18).

The United States conducts more than 200 million clinical assays of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$each year with ion-selective electrodes.

Analyte ions establish an ion-exchange equilibrium at the surface of the ion-selective membrane. Other ions that bind to the same sites interfere.

The ion-selective electrode responds to $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ with little response to $\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{OH})^{+}$or $\mathrm{Pb}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)(a q)$.

An electrode intended to measure ion A also responds to ion X . The selectivity coefficient gives the relative response to different species with the same charge:

Selectivity coefficient:

$$
K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\text {Pot }}=\frac{\text { response to } \mathrm{X}}{\text { response to } \mathrm{A}}
$$

The superscript "Pot" for "potentiometric" is customary in the chemical literature. The smaller the selectivity coefficient, the less the interference by $\mathrm{X} . \mathrm{A} \mathrm{K}^{+}$ion-selective electrode that uses the chelator valinomycin as the liquid ion exchanger has selectivity coefficients $K_{\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=1 \times 10^{-5}, K_{\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cs}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=0.44$, and $K_{\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Rb}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=2.8$. These coefficients tell us that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$hardly interferes with the measurement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, but $\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Rb}^{+}$interfere strongly. In fact, the electrode responds more to $\mathrm{Rb}^{+}$than to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

If the response to each ion is Nernstian, then the response of an ion-selective electrode to its primary ion (A) and to interfering ions of the same charge (X) is ${ }^{10,25}$

Response of ionselective electrode:

$$
E=\text { constant } \pm \frac{0.05916}{z_{\mathrm{A}}} \log \left[\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}+\sum_{\mathrm{X}} K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\text {Pot }} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{X}}\right]
$$

where $z_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the magnitude of the charge of $\mathrm{A}, \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{X}}$ are activities, and $K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\text {Pot }}$ is the selectivity coefficient for each interfering ion. If the ion-selective electrode is connected to the positive terminal of the potentiometer, the sign of the $\log$ term is positive if A is a cation and negative if A is an anion. Box 14-2 describes how selectivity coefficients are measured.

## BOX 14-2 Measuring Selectivity Coefficients for an Ion-Selective Electrode

When measuring selectivity coefficients, you must demonstrate that the response of the electrode to each interfering ion follows the Nernst equation. ${ }^{26,27,28}$ This is not as simple as it sounds. An ion-selective membrane that has equilibrated with its primary ion may become kinetically insensitive to weakly bound interfering ions.

The graph shows the separate solution method for measuring selectivity coefficients. In this method, a calibration curve is
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/60d08d7b-1e7a-4130-87f8-996c404932a8-17.jpg?height=868&width=771&top_left_y=1407&top_left_x=172)

[^0]constructed for each ion by itself. Other common procedures are the fixed interference method and the matched potential method. ${ }^{26}$

The graph shows the response of a sodium ion-selective electrode to the interfering ions $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. To obtain a Nernstian response to interfering ions, the electrode was prepared in the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The electrode was filled with 0.01 M KCl and soaked in 0.01 M KCl overnight to condition the ion-selective membrane prior to measurements. After measuring $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$was measured. For subsequent use to measure $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the inner filling solution is replaced by 0.01 M NaCl .

The data demonstrate a near-Nernstian response for each ion. At the laboratory temperature of $21.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, Nernstian response would be $(R T \ln 10) / z F=58.5 / z \mathrm{mV}$ per decade (factor of 10$)$ of ion activity, where $z$ is the charge of the ion. Measured slopes are $61.3 \pm 1.5 \mathrm{mV}$ for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, 56.3 \pm 0.6 \mathrm{mV}$ for $\mathrm{K}^{+}, 26.0 \pm 1.0 \mathrm{mV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and $31.2 \pm 0.7 \mathrm{mV}$ for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The deviation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from a straight line above an activity of $10^{-2.5}$ is attributed to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$impurity in highpurity $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$. Electrode response to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is much greater than to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, so a little $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$has a large effect.

To find the selectivity coefficient, we measure the difference between the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$calibration line and the line for an interfering ion at any chosen activity and apply the formula

$$
\log K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=\frac{z_{\mathrm{A}} F\left(E_{\mathrm{X}}-E_{\mathrm{A}}\right)}{R T \ln 10}+\log \left(\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}}{\left(\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)^{z_{\mathrm{A}} / z_{\mathrm{x}}}}\right)
$$

where $\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{Na}^{+}$with charge $z_{\mathrm{A}}=1$ and X is an interfering ion of charge $z_{\mathrm{X}}$. At an activity of $10^{-3}$, the dashed line shows a difference of $E_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}=-363 \mathrm{mV}$. The selectivity coefficient is

$$
\log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=\frac{(+1) F(-0.363 \mathrm{~V})}{R T \ln 10}+\log \left(\frac{10^{-3}}{\left(10^{-3}\right)^{1 / 2}}\right)=-7.0
$$

We could choose a different activity to measure $E_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$and should find the same $K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}$. The other lines in the graph give log $K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}^{\text {Pot }}=-8.0$ and $\log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\text {Pot }}=-4.9$.

Problem 14-43 provides a formula for estimating the error in measuring primary ion A caused by interfering ion X , which need not have the same charge as A .

## EXAMPLE Using the Selectivity Coefficient

A fluoride ion-selective electrode has a selectivity coefficient $K_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}=0.1$. What will be the change in electrode potential when $1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{F}^{-}$at pH 5.5 is raised to pH 10.5 ?

Solution From Equation 14-10, we find the potential with negligible $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$at pH 5.5 :

$$
E=\text { constant }-0.05916 \log \left[1.0 \times 10^{-4}\right]=\text { constant }+236.6 \mathrm{mV}
$$

At $\mathrm{pH} 10.50,\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=3.2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$, so the electrode potential is

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =\text { constant }-0.05916 \log \left[1.0 \times 10^{-4}+(0.1)\left(3.2 \times 10^{-4}\right)\right] \\
& =\text { constant }+229.5 \mathrm{mV}
\end{aligned}
$$

The change is $229.5-236.6=-7.1 \mathrm{mV}$, which is quite significant. If you didn't know about the pH change, you would think that the concentration of $\mathrm{F}^{-}$had increased by $32 \%$.

Test Yourself Find the change in potential when $1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{F}^{-}$at pH 5.5 is raised to pH 9.5 . (Answer: -0.8 mV )

## Solid-State Electrodes

A solid-state ion-selective electrode based on an inorganic crystal is shown in Figure 14-19. A common electrode of this type is the fluoride electrode, employing a crystal of $\mathrm{LaF}_{3}$ doped with $\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$. Doping means adding a small amount of $\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$ in place of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$. The filling solution contains 0.1 M NaF and 0.1 M NaCl . Fluoride electrodes are used to monitor the fluoridation of municipal water supplies.

To conduct a tiny electric current, $\mathrm{F}^{-}$migrates across the $\mathrm{LaF}_{3}$ crystal, as shown in Figure 14-20. Anion vacancies are created within the crystal when we dope $\mathrm{LaF}_{3}$ with $\mathrm{EuF}_{2}$. An adjacent fluoride ion can jump into the vacancy, leaving a new vacancy behind. In this manner, $\mathrm{F}^{-}$diffuses from one side to the other.

By analogy with the pH electrode, the response of the $\mathrm{F}^{-}$electrode is
Response of $F^{-}$electrode: $\quad E=$ constant $-\beta(0.05916) \log \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{F}}$-(outside)
where $\beta$ is close to 1.00 . Equation 14-12 has a negative sign before the log term because fluoride is an anion. The $\mathrm{F}^{-}$electrode has a nearly Nernstian response over a $\mathrm{F}^{-}$concentration range from about $10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ to 1 M (Figure 14-21). The electrode is more responsive to $\mathrm{F}^{-}$than to most other ions by $>1000$. The only interfering species is $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, for which the selectivity coefficient is $K_{\mathrm{F}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}=0.1$. At low $\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{F}^{-}$is converted to $\mathrm{HF}\left(\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}=3.17\right)$, to which the electrode is insensitive.

A routine procedure for measuring $\mathrm{F}^{-}$is to dilute the unknown in a high ionic strength buffer containing acetic acid, sodium citrate, NaCl , and NaOH to adjust the pH to 5.5. The

FIGURE 14-20 Migration of $\mathrm{F}^{-}$through $\mathrm{LaF}_{3}$ doped with $\mathrm{EuF}_{2}$. Because $\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$ has less charge than $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$, an anion vacancy occurs for every $\mathrm{Eu}^{2+}$. A neighboring $\mathrm{F}^{-}$can jump into the vacancy, thereby moving the vacancy to another site. Repetition of this process moves $\mathrm{F}^{-}$through the lattice.

buffer keeps all standards and unknowns at a constant ionic strength, so the fluoride activity coefficient is constant in all solutions (and can therefore be ignored).

$$
\begin{aligned}
E= & \text { constant }-\beta(0.05916) \log \left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right] \gamma_{\mathrm{F}^{-}} \\
= & \underbrace{\text { constant }-\beta(0.05916) \log \gamma_{\mathrm{F}^{-}}}_{\substack{\text { This expression is constant because } \\
\gamma_{\mathrm{F}^{-}} \text {is constant at constant ionic strength }}}-\beta(0.05916) \log \left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

At pH 5.5, there is no interference by $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and little conversion of $\mathrm{F}^{-}$to HF . Citrate complexes $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, which would otherwise bind $\mathrm{F}^{-}$and interfere with the analysis.

## EXAMPLE Response of an Ion-Selective Electrode

When a fluoride electrode was immersed in standard solutions (maintained at a constant ionic strength of 0.1 M with $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ ), the following potentials (versus S.C.E.) were observed:

| $\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right](\mathrm{M})$ | $E(\mathrm{mV})$ |
| :--- | :---: |
| $1.00 \times 10^{-5}$ | 100.0 |
| $1.00 \times 10^{-4}$ | 41.5 |
| $1.00 \times 10^{-3}$ | -17.0 |

Because the ionic strength is constant, the response should depend on the logarithm of the $\mathrm{F}^{-}$concentration. Find $\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]$in an unknown that gave a potential of 0.0 mV .

Solution We fit the calibration data with Equation 14-12:

$$
E=m \underbrace{\log \left[\mathrm{~F}^{-}\right]}_{x}+b
$$

Plotting $E$ versus $\log \left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]$gives a straight line with a slope $m=-58.5 \mathrm{mV}$ and a $y$-intercept $b=-192.5 \mathrm{mV}$. Setting $E=0.0 \mathrm{mV}$, we solve for $\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]$:

$$
0.0 \mathrm{mV}=(-58.5 \mathrm{mV}) \log \left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]-192.5 \mathrm{mV} \Rightarrow\left[\mathrm{~F}^{-}\right]=5.1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}
$$

Test Yourself Find $\left[\mathrm{F}^{-}\right]$if $E=81.2 \mathrm{mV}$. Is the calibration curve valid for $E=110.7 \mathrm{mV}$ ? (Answer: $2.1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$; no, because calibration points do not go above 100 mV )

Another common inorganic crystal electrode uses $\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ for the membrane. This electrode responds to $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and to $\mathrm{S}^{2-}$. If we dope the electrode with $\mathrm{CuS}, \mathrm{CdS}$, or PbS , we can prepare electrodes sensitive to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$, or $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, respectively (Table 14-5).

Figure 14-22 illustrates the mechanism by which a CdS crystal responds selectively to certain ions. The crystal can be cleaved to expose planes of Cd atoms or S atoms. The Cd plane in Figure 14-22a selectively adsorbs $\mathrm{HS}^{-}$ions, whereas an S plane does not interact strongly with $\mathrm{HS}^{-}$. Figure 14-22b shows strong response of the exposed Cd face to $\mathrm{HS}^{-}$, but only weak response when the S face is exposed. The opposite behavior is observed in response to $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ ions. The partial response of the S face to $\mathrm{HS}^{-}$in the upper curve is attributed to about $10 \%$ of the exposed atoms actually being Cd instead of S .

## Liquid-Based Ion-Selective Electrodes

A liquid-based ion-selective electrode is similar to the solid-state electrode in Figure 14-19, except that the liquid-based electrode has a hydrophobic membrane impregnated with a hydrophobic ion exchanger (called an ionophore) that is selective for analyte ion (Figure 14-23). The response of a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion-selective electrode is given by

$$
\text { Response of } \mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \text { electrode: } \quad E=\text { constant }+\beta\left(\frac{0.05916}{2}\right) \log \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}(\text { outside })
$$

where $\beta$ is close to 1.00 . Equations 14-13 and 14-12 have different signs before the log term because one involves an anion and the other a cation. Note also that the charge of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ requires a factor of 2 in the denominator before the logarithm.

The membrane at the bottom of the electrode in Figure 14-23 is made from poly(vinyl chloride) impregnated with ion exchanger. One particular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ liquid ion exchanger consists

of the neutral hydrophobic ligand ( L ), called an ionophore, and a salt of the hydrophobic anion ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+} \mathrm{R}^{-}$) dissolved in a hydrophobic liquid (Figure 14-24) in the poly(vinyl chloride) membrane. The most serious interference comes from $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$. The selectivity coefficient in Equation 14-9 is $K_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Sr}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=0.13$, which means that the response to $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ is $13 \%$ as great as the response to an equal concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. For most cations, $K_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{x}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}<10^{-3}$.

The Phoenix Mars Lander at the opening of this chapter had 11 liquid-based ion-selective electrodes (Figure 14-25) and 4 solid-state electrodes built into the walls of each Wet Chemistry Laboratory beaker. The liquid-based ion-selective electrodes for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$used an ionophore called ETH 2418 (Figure 14-26). This ionophore responds over the pH range 1 to 9 and has selectivity coefficients $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{-8.6}, K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{-9.7}$, and $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{-7.8}$. Box 14-3 tells how electrode interference led to the discovery of perchlorate on Mars. ${ }^{29}$

## Breakthrough in Ion-Selective Electrode Detection Limits ${ }^{\mathbf{2 4}}$

The black curve in Figure 14-27 is typical of many liquid-based ion-selective electrodes. The electrode detects changes in $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ concentration above $10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ but is unresponsive for $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]< 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$. The solution in the internal electrode compartment contains $0.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{PbCl}_{2}$.

The colored curve in Figure 14-27 was obtained with the same electrode, but the internal filling solution was replaced by a metal ion buffer (Section 14-7) that fixes $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]$ at $10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$. Now the electrode responds to changes in $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]$ down to $\sim 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$.

The sensitivity of liquid-based ion-selective electrodes has been limited by leakage of the primary ion ( $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, in this case) from the internal filling solution through the ion-exchange membrane. Leakage provides a substantial concentration of primary ion at the external surface of the membrane. If analyte concentration is below $10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$, leakage from the electrode maintains an effective concentration near $10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ at the outer surface of the electrode. If we can lower the concentration of primary ion inside the electrode, the concentration of leaking

## BOX 14-3 How Was Perchlorate Discovered on Mars? ${ }^{29}$

Nobody expected perchlorate ( $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$) to be abundant on Mars, so the Phoenix Mars Lander Wet Chemistry Laboratory was not designed to look for $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$. However, the nitrate ion-selective electrode sent to Mars was 1000 times more sensitive to $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$than to $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$. That is, $K_{\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}, \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{3}$. Liquid used to leach ions from the soil had a constant $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$background near 1 mM . Nitrate would only be detected if it were present at concentrations above 1 mM .

When salts were leached from soil in the Wet Chemistry Laboratory, the $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$electrode potential changed by 200 mV ,
corresponding to an apparent $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$concentration above 1 M , which would have required more $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$than the mass of soil that was analyzed. However, $4-6 \mathrm{mg}_{\text {g }}$ of $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$in 1 g of soil would have produced the observed response. Heating the soil released a product at $400^{\circ}-600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a molecular mass of 32 (likely $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ), consistent with thermal decomposition of $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$. Perchlorate occurs at similar levels on Earth in arid regions including the Atacama Desert. On Earth, $\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$is thought to arise from photochemical reactions of ozone ( $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ) with chlorine species in the atmosphere.

ion outside the membrane is reduced by orders of magnitude and the detection limit is correspondingly reduced. The sensitivity of a solid-state electrode cannot be lowered by changing the filling solution, because analyte concentration is governed by the solubility of the inorganic salt crystal forming the ion-sensitive membrane.

The response of the electrode with $10^{-12} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ in the filling solution is limited by interference from $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the internal solution, which contains $0.05 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Na}_{2}$ EDTA from the metal ion buffer. When the filling solution is buffered to $10^{-12} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$, the apparent selectivity coefficient is decreased by one to five orders of magnitude for most interfering cations. Not only is the detection limit for $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ improved by $10^{5}$, but the selectivity for $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ over other cations increases by several orders of magnitude. Table 14-6 gives detection limits and selectivity coefficients for ion-selective electrodes in which precautions are taken to prevent leakage of the primary ion.

## Compound Electrodes

Compound electrodes contain a conventional electrode surrounded by a membrane that isolates (or generates) the analyte to which the electrode responds. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas-sensing electrode in Figure 14-28 consists of an ordinary glass pH electrode surrounded by a thin layer of electrolyte solution enclosed in a semipermeable membrane made of rubber, Teflon,

A new direction in ion-selective electrodes is to eliminate the internal filling solution entirely. lonophore is coated onto or dissolved in an electrically conducting polymer that serves as an ion-to-electron transducer. ${ }^{30} \mathrm{~A}$ nitrate-selective all-solid-state electrode based on the conductive polymer polypyrrole can be made in a student experiment. ${ }^{31}$

## Advantages of ion-selective electrodes:

- linear response to $\log \mathcal{A}$ over a wide range
- nondestructive
- noncontaminating
- short response time
- unaffected by color or turbidity

A $1-\mathrm{mV}$ error in potential corresponds to a $4 \%$ error in monovalent ion activity. A $5-\mathrm{mV}$ error corresponds to a $22 \%$ error. The relative error doubles for divalent ions and triples for trivalent ions.

When $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses through the semipermeable membrane, it lowers the pH in the electrolyte. The response of the glass electrode to the change in pH is a measure of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration outside the electrode. Other acidic or basic gases, including $\mathrm{NH}_{3}, \mathrm{SO}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}, \mathrm{NO}_{x}$ (nitrogen oxides), and $\mathrm{HN}_{3}$ (hydrazoic acid) can be detected in the same manner. These electrodes can be used to measure gases in solution or in the gas phase.

It is not necessary to use the compound electrode for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ in aqueous solution. Ionophores are available to measure $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$with conventional liquid-based ionselective electrodes. ${ }^{33}$

Numerous ingenious compound electrodes use enzymes. ${ }^{34}$ These devices contain a conventional electrode coated with an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction of the analyte. The product of the reaction is detected by the electrode.

## 14-7 Using lon-Selective Electrodes

Ion-selective electrodes respond linearly to the logarithm of analyte activity over four to six orders of magnitude. Electrodes do not consume unknowns, and they introduce negligible contamination. Response time is seconds or minutes, so electrodes are used to monitor flow streams in industrial applications. Color and turbidity do not hinder electrodes. Microelectrodes can be used inside living cells.

Precision is rarely better than $1 \%$ and is usually worse. Electrodes can be fouled by proteins or other organic solutes and the fouling leads to sluggish, drifting response. Certain ions interfere with or poison particular electrodes. Some electrodes are fragile and have limited shelf life.

Electrodes respond to the activity of uncomplexed analyte ion. Therefore, ligands must be absent or masked. Because we usually wish to know concentrations, not activities, an inert salt is often used to bring all standards and samples to a high, constant ionic strength. If activity coefficients are constant, the electrode potential gives concentrations directly.

Human blood plasma has eight major calcium-containing species that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis and measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (Figure 14-29) You will learn about these techniques later in this book. Of the eight species, one with a concentration of 1.05 mM was identified as free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. In the other seven species, with a total concentration of $1.21 \mathrm{mM}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is bound to proteins or other ligands. When $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in blood was measured with an ion-selective electrode, only free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ was observed. ${ }^{35}$ Calcium bound to ligands is invisible to an ion-selective electrode.

## Standard Addition with Ion-Selective Electrodes

When ion-selective electrodes are used, it is important that the composition of the standard solution closely approximates the composition of the unknown. The medium in which the analyte exists is called the matrix. For complex or unknown matrixes, the standard addition method (Section 5-3) can be used. In this technique, the electrode is immersed in unknown and the potential is recorded. Then a small volume of standard solution is added, so as not to perturb the ionic strength of the unknown. The change in potential tells how the electrode responds to analyte and, therefore, how much analyte was in the unknown. It is best to add several successive aliquots and use a graphical procedure to extrapolate back to the concentration of unknown. Standard addition is best if the additions increase analyte to 1.5 to 3 times its original concentration.

The graphical procedure is based on the equation for the response of the ion-selective electrode, which we will write in the form

$$
E=k+\beta\left(\frac{R T \ln 10}{n F}\right) \log [\mathrm{X}]
$$

where $E$ is the meter reading in volts and $[\mathrm{X}]$ is the concentration of analyte. This reading is the difference in potential of the ion-selective electrode and the reference electrode. The constants $k$ and $\beta$ depend on the particular ion-selective electrode. The factor $(R T / F)$ ln 10 is 0.05916 V at 298.15 K . If $\beta=1$, then the response is Nernstian. We abbreviate the term $(\beta R T / n F)$ ln 10 as $S$.

Let the initial volume of unknown be $V_{0}$ and the initial concentration of analyte be $c_{\mathrm{X}}$. Let the volume of added standard be $V_{\mathrm{S}}$ and the concentration of standard be $c_{\mathrm{S}}$. Then the total concentration of analyte after standard is added is $\left(V_{0} c_{\mathrm{X}}+V_{\mathrm{S}} c_{\mathrm{S}}\right) /\left(V_{0}+V_{\mathrm{S}}\right)$. Substituting this expression for $[\mathrm{X}]$ in Equation 14-14 and doing some rearrangement gives

Standard addition plot for ion-selective electrode:

$$
\underbrace{\left(V_{0}+V_{\mathrm{S}}\right) 10^{E / S}}_{y}=\underbrace{10^{k / S} V_{0} c_{\mathrm{X}}}_{b}+\underbrace{10^{k / S} c_{\mathrm{S}} V_{\mathrm{S}}}_{m} \uparrow_{x}
$$

A graph of $\left(V_{0}+V_{\mathrm{S}}\right) 10^{E / S}$ on the $y$-axis versus $V_{\mathrm{S}}$ on the $x$-axis has a slope $m=10^{k / S} c_{\mathrm{S}}$ and a $y$-intercept of $10^{k / S} V_{0} c_{\mathrm{X}}$ (Figure 14-30). The $x$-intercept is found by setting $y=0$ :

$$
x \text {-intercept }=-\frac{b}{m}=-\frac{10^{k / S} V_{0} c_{\mathrm{X}}}{10^{k / S} c_{\mathrm{S}}}=-\frac{V_{0} c_{\mathrm{X}}}{c_{\mathrm{S}}}
$$

Equation 14-16 gives us the concentration of unknown, $c_{\mathrm{X}}$, from $V_{0}, c_{\mathrm{S}}$, and the $x$-intercept.

A weakness of standard addition with ion-selective electrodes is that we cannot measure $\beta$ in Equation 14-14 in the unknown matrix. We could measure $\beta$ in a series of standard solutions (not containing unknown) and use this value to compute $S$ in the function $\left(V_{0}+V_{\mathrm{S}}\right) 10^{E / S}$ in Equation 14-15. Another procedure is to add a concentrated, known matrix to the unknown and to all standards so that the matrix is essentially the same in all solutions.

## Metal Ion Buffers

It is pointless to dilute $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$ to $10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ for standardizing an ion-selective electrode. At this low concentration, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ might be lost by adsorption on glass or reaction with impurities.

An alternative is to prepare a metal ion buffer from the metal and a suitable ligand. For example, consider the reaction of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ with EDTA at pH 6.00 at which the fraction of EDTA in the form $\mathrm{Y}^{4-}$ is $\alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}=1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ (Table 11-1):

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+\mathrm{Y}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaY}^{2-} \\
K_{\mathrm{f}}=10^{10.65}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right] \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}[\mathrm{EDTA}]}
\end{gathered}
$$

If equal concentrations of $\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}$ and EDTA are present in a solution,

$$
\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}\right]}{\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}[\mathrm{EDTA}]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}\right]}{\left(10^{10.65}\right)\left(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\right)[\mathrm{EDTA}]}=1.2 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}
$$

## EXAMPLE Preparing a Metal Ion Buffer

What concentration of EDTA should be added to $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CaY}^{2-}$ at pH 6.00 to give $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]= 1.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ ?

Solution From Equation 14-17, we write

$$
[\mathrm{EDTA}]=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}\right]}{K_{\mathrm{f}} \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4}}-\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]}=\frac{0.010}{\left(10^{10.65}\right)\left(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\right)\left(1.00 \times 10^{-6}\right)}=0.012_{4} \mathrm{M}
$$

These are practical concentrations of $\mathrm{CaY}^{2-}$ and of EDTA.
Test Yourself What concentration of EDTA should be added to $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CaY}^{2-}$ at pH 6.00 to give $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ ? (Answer: $0.12_{4} \mathrm{M}$ )

A metal ion buffer is the only way to obtain $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]=10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$ for the electrode filling solution in Figure 14-27.

The darkest color is for atoms on the front face of the cube. Atoms with successively lighter shades are on planes that are successively further from the front face.

## Semiconductors and Diodes

Semiconductors such as Si (Figure 14-32), Ge, and GaAs are materials whose electrical resistivity ${ }^{37}$ lies between those of conductors and insulators. The four valence electrons of the pure materials are all involved in bonds between atoms (Figure 14-33a). A phosphorus impurity, with five valence electrons, provides one extra conduction electron that is free to move through the crystal (Figure 14-33b). An aluminum impurity has one less bonding electron than necessary, creating a vacancy called a hole, which behaves as a positive charge carrier. When a neighboring electron fills the hole, a new hole appears at an adjacent position (Figure 14-33c). A semiconductor with excess conduction electrons is called n-type, and one with excess holes is called p-type.

FIGURE 14-34 Behavior of a $p n$ junction, showing that current (a) can flow under forward bias conditions, but (b) is prevented from flowing under reverse bias.

A diode is a $p n$ junction (Figure 14-34a). If $n$ - Si is made negative with respect to $p$ - Si , electrons flow from the external circuit into the $n-\mathrm{Si}$. At the $p n$ junction, electrons and holes combine. As electrons move from the $p$-Si into the circuit, a fresh supply of holes is created in the $p-\mathrm{Si}$. The net result is that current flows when $n-\mathrm{Si}$ is negative with respect to $p-\mathrm{Si}$. The diode is said to be forward biased.

If the polarity is reversed (Figure 14-34b), electrons are drawn out of $n$-Si and holes are drawn out of $p$-Si, leaving a thin depletion region devoid of charge carriers near the pn junction. The diode is reverse biased and does not conduct current in the reverse direction.

## Chemical-Sensing Field Effect Transistor

The base of the field effect transistor in Figure 14-35 is constructed of $p$-Si with two $n$-type regions called source and drain. An insulating surface layer of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is overcoated by a conductive metal gate between source and drain. The source and the base are held at the same electric potential. When a voltage is applied between source and drain (Figure 14-35a), little current flows because the drain-base interface is a pn junction in reverse bias.

If the gate is made positive, electrons from the base are attracted toward the gate and form a conductive channel between source and drain (Figure 14-35b). Current increases as the gate is made more positive. The gate potential regulates the current between source and drain.

An activation energy is needed to get the charge carriers to move across the diode. For $\mathrm{Si}, \sim 0.6 \mathrm{~V}$ of forward bias is required before current will flow. For Ge , the requirement is $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~V}$.

For moderate reverse bias voltages, no current flows. If the voltage is sufficiently negative, breakdown occurs and current flows in the reverse direction.

The more positive the gate, the more current can flow between source and drain.

The essential feature of the chemical-sensing field effect transistor in Figure 14-36 is the chemically sensitive layer over the gate. An example is a layer of AgBr . When exposed to silver nitrate solution, $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is adsorbed on the AgBr (Figure 26-2), thereby giving it a positive charge and increasing current between source and drain. The voltage that must be applied by an external circuit to bring the current back to its initial value is the response to $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$. Figure 14-37 shows that $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$makes the gate more positive and $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$makes the gate more negative. The response is close to 59 mV for a 10-fold concentration change. The transistor is smaller (Figure 14-31) and more rugged than ion-selective electrodes. The sensing surface is typically only $1 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$.

## Summary

In potentiometric measurements, the indicator electrode responds to changes in the activity of analyte, and the reference electrode is a self-contained half-cell with a constant potential. The most common reference electrodes are calomel and silver-silver chloride. Common indicator electrodes include (1) the inert Pt electrode, (2) a silver electrode responsive to $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$, halides, and other ions that react with $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$, and (3) ion-selective electrodes. Unknown junction potentials at liquid-liquid interfaces limit the accuracy of most potentiometric measurements.

Ion-selective electrodes, including the glass pH electrode, respond mainly to one ion that is selectively bound to the ionexchange membrane of the electrode. The potential difference across the membrane, $E$, depends on the activity ( $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}$ ) of the target ion in the external analyte solution. At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the ideal relation is $E(\mathrm{~V})=$ constant $+(0.05916 / n) \ln \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{o}}$, where $n$ is the charge of the target ion. For interfering ions (X) with the same charge as the primary ion (A), the response of ion-selective electrodes is $E=$ constant $\pm(0.05916 / n) \log \left[\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}+\Sigma K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\text {Pot }} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{X}}\right]$, where $K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\text {Pot }}$
is the selectivity coefficient for each species. Common ion-selective electrodes can be classified as solid state, liquid based, and compound. Quantitation with ion-selective electrodes is usually done with a calibration curve or by the method of standard addition. Metal ion buffers are appropriate for establishing and maintaining
low concentrations of ions. A chemical-sensing field effect transistor is a solid-state device that uses a chemically sensitive coating to alter the electrical properties of a semiconductor in response to changes in the chemical environment.

## Exercises

14-A. The apparatus in Figure 14-7 was used to monitor the titration of 50.0 mL of $0.100 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ with 0.200 M NaBr . Calculate the cell voltage at each volume of NaBr , and sketch the titration curve: $1.0,12.5,24.0,24.9,25.1,26.0$, and 35.0 mL .

14-B. The apparatus in the figure can follow the course of an EDTA titration and was used to generate the curves in Figure 11-10. The heart of the cell is a pool of liquid Hg in contact with the solution and with a Pt wire. A small amount of $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$ added to the analyte equilibrates with a very tiny amount of $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}+\mathrm{Y}^{4-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HgY}^{2-} \\
K_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right]}=10^{21.5}
\end{gathered}
$$

The redox equilibrium $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}(l)$ is established rapidly at the surface of the Hg electrode, so the Nernst equation for the cell
can be written in the form

$$
E=E_{+}-E_{-}=\left(0.852-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]}\right)\right)-E_{-}
$$

where $E_{-}$is the constant potential of the reference electrode. From Equation A, $\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]=\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right] / K_{\mathrm{f}}\left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right]$, and this can be substituted into Equation B to give

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =0.852-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right] K_{\mathrm{f}}}{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}\right)-E_{-} \\
& =0.852-E_{-}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{K_{\mathrm{f}}}{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}\right)-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

where $K_{\mathrm{f}}$ is the formation constant for $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$. This apparatus thus responds to the changing EDTA concentration during an EDTA titration.

Suppose that such an electrode gave a potential of +100 mV (versus S.C.E.) in $10^{-5} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaF}$ and +41 mV in $10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaF}$. Sketch qualitatively how the potential would vary if the electrode were immersed in $10^{-5} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaF}$ and the pH ranged from 1 to 13.

to a $100-\mathrm{mL}$ volumetric flask. The $20.0-\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot was treated with 10.0 mL of 10.0 M NaOH plus enough NaI to complex the Hg catalyst from the digestion and diluted to 100.0 mL . When measured with the ammonia electrode, this solution gave a reading of 339.3 mV . Calculate the $\mathrm{wt} \%$ nitrogen in the food sample.

14-F. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ from cigarette smoke was collected by bubbling smoke through aqueous NaOH and measured with a sulfide ion-selective electrode.

| $V_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{mL})$ | $E(\mathrm{~V})$ | $V_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{mL})$ | $E(\mathrm{~V})$ |

Prepare a graph with Equation 14-15 and find $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in the unknown.

14-41. Standard addition with confidence interval. Ammonia in seawater was measured with an ammonia-selective electrode. A 100.0 mL aliquot of seawater was treated with 1.00 mL of 10 M NaOH to convert $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. Therefore, $V_{0}=101.0 \mathrm{~mL}$. A reading was then taken with the electrode. Then a series of 10.00 mL aliquots of standard $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$were added with results in the table.

| $V_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{mL})$ | $E(\mathrm{~V})$ | $V_{\mathrm{S}}(\mathrm{mL})$ | $E(\mathrm{~V})$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | -0.0844 | 30.00 | -0.0394 |
| 10.00 | -0.0581 | 40.00 | -0.0347 |

The standard contains $100.0 \mathrm{ppm}(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L})$ of nitrogen in the form of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. A separate experiment determined that the electrode slope $\beta R T(\ln 10) / F$ is 0.0566 V .
(a) Prepare a standard addition graph. Find the concentration and 95\% confidence interval for ammonia nitrogen (ppm) in the 100.0 mL of seawater.
(b) Standard addition is best if the additions increase analyte to 1.5 to 3 times its original concentration. Does this experiment fall in that range? A criticism of this experiment is that too much added standard creates error because the standards contribute too much to the computed result and the reading from the initial solution is not weighted heavily enough.

14-42. Data below come from the graph in Box 14-2, for which the separate solutions method was used to measure selectivity coefficients for a sodium ion-selective electrode at $21.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Use Equation 14-11 to calculate $\log K^{\text {Pot }}$ for each line below.
( $E_{\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$) at $\mathcal{A}=10^{-3}=-0.385 \mathrm{~V} \Rightarrow \log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=$ ?
( $E_{\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$) at $\mathcal{A}=10^{-2}=-0.418 \mathrm{~V} \Rightarrow \log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=$ ?
( $E_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$) at $\mathcal{A}=10^{-3}=-0.285 \mathrm{~V} \Rightarrow \log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}}^{2 \mathrm{Pot}^{+}}=$?
( $E_{\mathrm{K}^{+}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}$) at $\mathcal{A}=10^{-1.5}=-0.285 \mathrm{~V} \Rightarrow \log K_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=$ ?
14-43. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion-selective electrode on the Phoenix Mars Lander has selectivity coefficients $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{-8.6}$ and $K_{\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}=10^{-7.8}$. Let A be the primary ion sensed by the electrode and let its charge be $z_{\mathrm{A}}$. Let X be an interfering ion with charge $z_{\mathrm{X}}$. The relative error in primary ion activity due to an interfering ion is ${ }^{46}$

$$
\text { Error in } \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}(\%)=\frac{\left(K_{\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{Pot}}\right)^{z_{\mathrm{X}} / z_{\mathrm{A}}} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{z_{\mathrm{X}} / z_{\mathrm{A}}}} \times 100
$$

This expression applies for errors less than $\sim 10 \%$. If the pH is 8.0 ( $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=10^{-8.0}$ ) and $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Na}^{+}}=10^{-2.0}$, what is the relative error in measuring $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$? If the pH is 8.0 and $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}=10^{-2.0}$, what is the relative error in measuring $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}$?
14-44. $\mathrm{A} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion-selective electrode was calibrated in metal ion buffers with ionic strength fixed at 0.50 M . Using the following electrode readings, write an equation for the response of the electrode to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.

| $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right](\mathrm{M})$ | $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right](\mathrm{M})$ | mV |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| $1.00 \times 10^{-6}$ | 0 | -52.6 |
| $2.43 \times 10^{-4}$ | 0 | +16.1 |
| $1.00 \times 10^{-6}$ | $3.68 \times 10^{-3}$ | -38.0 |

14-45. The $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ion buffer used inside the electrode for the colored curve in Figure 14-27 was prepared by mixing 1.0 mL of 0.10 M $\mathrm{Pb}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ with 100.0 mL of $0.050 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Na}_{2}$ EDTA. At the measured pH of 4.34, $\alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}=1.46 \times 10^{-8}$ (Equation 11-4). Show that $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]= 1.4 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$.

14-46. Solutions with a wide range of $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ concentrations were prepared to calibrate an experimental $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ ion-selective electrode. For the range $10^{-5}<\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]<10^{-1} \mathrm{M}, \mathrm{Hg}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ was used directly. The range $10^{-11}<\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]<10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ could be covered by the buffer system $\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}(s)+\mathrm{KCl}(a q)$ (based on $\mathrm{p} K_{\text {sp }}$ for $\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}=13.16$ ). The
range $10^{-15}<\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]<10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$ was obtained with $\mathrm{HgBr}_{2}(s)+ \mathrm{KBr}(a q)$ (based on $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ for $\mathrm{HgBr}_{2}=17.43$ ). The resulting calibration curve is shown in the figure. Calibration points for the $\mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$ / KCl buffer are not in line with the other data. Suggest a possible explanation.

$\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ ion-selective electrode calibration curve from J. A. Shatkin, H. S. Brown, and S. Licht, "Composite Graphite Ion Selective Electrode Array Potentiometry for the Detection of Mercury and Other Relevant Ions in Aquatic Systems," Anal. Chem. 1995, 67, 1147. It was not stated in the paper, but we presume that all solutions had the same ionic strength.

14-47. Activity problem. Citric acid is a triprotic acid ( $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{~A}$ ) whose anion ( $\mathrm{A}^{3-}$ ) forms stable complexes with many metal ions.

$$
\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+\mathrm{A}^{3-} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{CaA}^{-}
$$

When a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion-selective electrode with a slope of 29.58 mV was immersed in a solution having $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}=1.00 \times 10^{-3}$, the reading was +2.06 mV . Calcium citrate solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of solutions 1 and 2 .

Solution 1:

$$
\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]=1.00 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}, \mathrm{pH}=8.00, \mu=0.10 \mathrm{M}
$$

Solution 2:

$$
[\text { Citrate }]_{\text {total }}=1.00 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}, \mathrm{pH}=8.00, \mu=0.10 \mathrm{M}
$$

The calcium citrate solution gave an electrode reading of -25.90 mV . (a) Refer to the discussion with Figure B-2 in Appendix B. Calculate the activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the calcium citrate solution.
(b) Calculate the formation constant, $K_{\mathrm{f}}$, for $\mathrm{CaA}^{-}$. Assume that the size of $\mathrm{CaA}^{-}$is 500 pm . At pH 8.00 and $\mu=0.10 \mathrm{M}$, the fraction of free citrate in the form $\mathrm{A}^{3-}$ is 0.998 .
