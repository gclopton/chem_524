#### Abstract

- lectrochemistry is a major branch of analytical chemistry that uses electrical measurements - of chemical systems for analytical purposes. ${ }^{1,2}$ For example, the opening of Chapter 1 showed an electrode being used to measure neurotransmitter molecules released by a nerve cell. Electrochemistry also refers to the use of electricity to drive a chemical reaction or to the use of a chemical reaction to produce electricity.


## 13-1 Basic Concepts

A redox reaction involves transfer of electrons from one species to another. A species is said to be oxidized when it loses electrons. It is reduced when it gains electrons. An oxidizing agent, also called an oxidant, takes electrons from another substance and becomes reduced. A reducing agent, also called a reductant, gives electrons to another substance and is oxidized in the process. In the reaction

$$
\underset{\substack{\text { Oxidizing } \\ \text { agent }}}{\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}+\underset{\substack{\text { Reducing } \\ \text { agent }}}{\mathrm{V}^{2+}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{V}^{3+}
$$

$\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is the oxidizing agent because it takes an electron from $\mathrm{V}^{2+} . \mathrm{V}^{2+}$ is the reducing agent because it gives an electron to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} . \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is reduced, and $\mathrm{V}^{2+}$ is oxidized as the reaction proceeds from left to right. Appendix D reviews oxidation numbers and balancing of redox equations.

## Chemistry and Electricity

When electrons from a redox reaction flow through an electric circuit, we can learn something about the reaction by measuring current and voltage. Electric current is proportional to the rate of reaction, and the cell voltage is proportional to the free energy change for the electrochemical reaction. In techniques such as voltammetry, the voltage can be used to identify reactants.

## Electric Charge

Electric charge ( $q$ ) is measured in coulombs ( C ). The magnitude of the charge of a single electron is $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$, so a mole of electrons has a charge of $\left(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)(6.022 \times \left.10^{23} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)=9.649 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}$, which is called the Faraday constant, $F$.

Relation between charge and moles:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q & =n \cdot F \\
\text { Coulombs } & \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{e}^{-} \frac{\text { Coulombs }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{e}^{-}}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $n$ is the number moles of electrons transferred.

## EXAMPLE Relating Coulombs to Quantity of Reaction

If 5.585 g of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ were reduced in Reaction 13-1, how many coulombs of charge must have been transferred from $\mathrm{V}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ?

Solution First, we find that 5.585 g of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ equal 0.1000 mol of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. Because each $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ion requires one electron in Reaction 13-1, 0.1000 mol of electrons must have been transferred. Using the Faraday constant, we find that 0.1000 mol of electrons corresponds to

$$
q=n F=\left(0.1000 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{e}^{-}\right)\left(9.649 \times 10^{4} \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{e}^{-}}\right)=9.649 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C}
$$

Test Yourself How many moles of $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ are reduced to $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ by 1.00 C of electric charge? (Answer: $5.18 \mu \mathrm{~mol}$ )

## Electric Current

The quantity of charge flowing each second through a circuit is called the current. The unit of current is the ampere, abbreviated A . A current of 1 ampere represents a charge of 1 coulomb per second flowing past a point in a circuit.

## EXAMPLE Relating Current to Rate of Reaction

Suppose that electrons are forced into a platinum wire immersed in a solution containing $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ (Figure 13-1), which is reduced to $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ at a constant rate of $4.24 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{h}$. How much current passes through the solution?
Solution Two electrons are required to reduce one $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ ion:

$$
\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Sn}^{2+}
$$

Electrons flow at a rate of $\left(2 \mathrm{mmole}^{-} / \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{Sn}^{4+}\right)\left(4.24 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{Sn}^{4+} / \mathrm{h}\right)=8.48 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}$, which corresponds to

$$
\frac{8.48 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}}{3600 \mathrm{~s} / \mathrm{h}}=2.356 \times 10^{-3} \frac{\mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{e}^{-}}{\mathrm{s}}=2.356 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{e}^{-}}{\mathrm{s}}
$$

To find the current, we convert moles of electrons per second into coulombs per second:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Current } & =\frac{\text { charge }}{\text { time }}=\frac{\text { coulombs }}{\text { second }}=\frac{\text { moles }^{-}}{\text {second }} \cdot \frac{\text { coulombs }}{\text { mole }} \\
& =\left(2.356 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~s}}\right)\left(9.649 \times 10^{4} \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~mol}}\right) \\
& =0.227 \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{s}=0.227 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}
$$

Test Yourself What current reduces $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ at a rate of $1.00 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{h}$ ? (Answer: 53.6 mA )

In Figure 13-1, we encountered a Pt electrode, which conducts electrons into or out of a chemical species in the redox reaction. Platinum is a common inert electrode. It does not participate in the redox chemistry except as a conductor of electrons.

## Voltage, Work, and Free Energy

The difference in electric potential, $E$, between two points is the work needed (or that can be done) when moving an electric charge from one point to the other. Potential difference is measured in volts (V). The greater the potential difference between two points, the stronger will be the "push" on a charged particle traveling between those points.

A good analogy for understanding current and potential is to think of water flowing through a garden hose (Figure 13-2). Current is the electric charge flowing past a point in a wire each second. Current is analogous to the volume of water flowing past a point in the hose each second. The difference in electric potential is a measure of the force pushing on the electrons. The greater the force, the more current flows. Potential difference is analogous to the pressure on the water in the hose. The greater the pressure, the faster the water flows.

When a charge, $q$, moves through a potential difference, $E$, the work done is

Relation between
work and voltage:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Work }=E \cdot q \\
& \text { Joules } \quad \text { Volts } \quad \text { Coulombs }
\end{aligned}
$$

Work has the dimensions of energy, whose units are joules (J). One joule of energy is gained or lost when 1 coulomb of charge moves between points whose potentials differ by 1 volt. Equation 13-3 tells us that the dimensions of volts are joules per coulomb $(1 \mathrm{~V}=1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{C})$.

## EXAMPLE Electrical Work

How much work can be done if 2.4 mmol of electrons fall through a potential difference of 0.27 V ?

Solution To use Equation 13-3, we must convert moles of electrons into coulombs of charge. The relation is

$$
q=n F=\left(2.4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol}\right)\left(9.649 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}\right)=2.3 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{C}
$$

The work that could be done is

$$
\text { Work }=E \cdot q=(0.27 \mathrm{~V})\left(2.3 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{C}\right)=62 \mathrm{~J}
$$

Test Yourself What must be the potential drop (V) for $1.00 \mu \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{e}^{-}$to do 1.00 J of work? (Answer: 10.4 V)

FIGURE 13-1 Electrons flowing into a coil of Pt wire at which $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ ions in solution are reduced to $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$. This process could not happen by itself, because there is no complete circuit. If $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}$ is to be reduced at this Pt electrode, some other species must be oxidized at some other place.

It takes work to move like charges toward one another. Work can be done when opposite charges move toward one another.

Electric current is analogous to volume of water per second flowing out of a hose.

Electric potential difference is analogous to the hydrostatic pressure pushing water through a hose. High pressure gives high flow.

FIGURE 13-2 Analogy between the flow of water through a hose and the flow of electricity through a wire.

Section 6-2 gave a brief discussion of $\Delta G$.
$q=n F$

The greater the voltage, the more current will flow. The greater the resistance, the less current will flow.

Box 13-1 shows measurements of the resistance of single molecules by measuring current and voltage and applying Ohm's law.

Power (watts) = work per second

FIGURE 13-3 A circuit with a battery and a resistor. Benjamin Franklin investigated static electricity in the 1740s. ${ }^{6}$ He thought electricity was a fluid that flows from a silk cloth to a glass rod when the rod is rubbed with the cloth. We now know that electrons flow from glass to silk. However, Franklin's convention for the direction of electric current has been retained, so we say that current flows from positive to negative-in the opposite direction of electron flow.

In the garden hose analogy, suppose that one end of a hose is raised 1 m above the other end and a volume of 1 L of water flows through the hose. The flowing water goes through a mechanical device to do a certain amount of work. If one end of the hose is raised 2 m above the other, the amount of work that can be done by the falling water is twice as great. The elevation difference between the ends of the hose is analogous to electric potential difference and the volume of water is analogous to electric charge. The greater the electric potential difference between two points in a circuit, the more work can be done by the charge flowing between those two points.

The free energy change, $\Delta G$, for a chemical reaction conducted reversibly at constant temperature and pressure equals the maximum possible electrical work that can be done by the reaction on its surroundings:

$$
\text { Work done on surroundings }=-\Delta G
$$

The negative sign in Equation 13-4 indicates that the free energy of a system decreases when the work is done on the surroundings.

Combining Equations 13-2, 13-3, and 13-4 produces a relation of utmost importance:

$$
\Delta G=- \text { work }=-E \cdot q
$$

Relation between free energy difference $\quad \Delta G=-n F E$
and electric potential difference:
Equation 13-5 relates the free energy change of a chemical reaction to the electrical potential difference (that is, the voltage) that can be generated by the reaction.

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's law states that current, $I$, is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) across a circuit and inversely proportional to the resistance, $R$, of the circuit.

Ohm's law:

$$
I=\frac{E}{R}
$$

Units of resistance are ohms, assigned the Greek symbol $\Omega$ (omega). A current of 1 ampere flows through a circuit with a potential difference of 1 volt if the resistance is 1 ohm. From Equation 13-6, the unit ampere (A) is equivalent to $\mathrm{V} / \Omega$.

## Power

Power, $P$, is the work done per unit time. The SI unit of power is $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{s}$, better known as the watt (W).

$$
P=\frac{\text { work }}{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{E \cdot q}{\mathrm{~s}}=E \cdot \frac{q}{\mathrm{~s}}
$$

Because $q /$ s is the current, $I$, we can write

$$
P=E \cdot I
$$

A cell capable of delivering 1 ampere at a potential difference of 1 volt has a power output of 1 watt.

## EXAMPLE Using Ohm's Law

In the circuit in Figure 13-3, the battery generates a potential difference of 3.0 V , and the resistor has a resistance of $100 \Omega$. We assume that the wire connecting the battery and the resistor has negligible resistance. Find the current and power delivered by the battery.

Solution The current is

$$
I=\frac{E}{R}=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~V}}{100 \Omega}=0.030 \mathrm{~A}=30 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

The power produced by the battery is

$$
P=E \cdot I=(3.0 \mathrm{~V})(0.030 \mathrm{~A})=90 \mathrm{~mW}
$$

Test Yourself What voltage is required to produce 180 mW of power? (Answer: 4.24 V )

The electrical conductance of a single molecule suspended between two gold electrodes is known from measurement of voltage and current by applying Ohm's law. Conductance is $1 /$ resistance, so it has the units $1 / \mathrm{ohm} \equiv$ siemens $(\mathrm{S})$.

To make molecular junctions, a gold scanning tunneling microscope tip was moved in and out of contact with a gold substrate in the presence of a solution containing a test molecule terminated by thiol (-SH) groups. Thiols spontaneously bind to gold, forming bridges such as that shown here. Nanoampere currents were observed with a potential difference of 0.1 V between the gold surfaces.

The graph shows four observations of conductance as the scanning tunneling microscope tip was pulled away from the Au substrate. Plateaus are observed at multiples of 19 nS . An interpretation is that a single molecule connecting two Au surfaces has a conductance of 19 nS (or a resistance of $50 \mathrm{M} \Omega$ ). If two molecules form parallel bridges, conductance increases to 38 nS . Three molecules give a conductance of 57 nS . If there are three bridges and the electrodes are pulled apart, one of the bridges breaks and conductance drops to 38 nS . When the second bridge breaks, conductance drops to 19 nS . The exact conductance varies because the environment of each molecule on the Au surface is not identical. A histogram of $>500$ observations in the inset shows peaks at 19, 38, and 57 nS .

Change in conductance as Au scanning tunneling microscope tip immersed in dithiol solution is withdrawn from Au substrate. [From X. Xiao, B. Xu, and N. Tao, "Conductance Titration of Single-Peptide Molecules," J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 5370.$]$

Alkane hydrocarbons can be thought of as prototypical electrical insulators. The conductance of alkane dithiols decreases exponentially as chain length increases: ${ }^{4}$

## 13-2 Galvanic Cells

A galvanic cell (also called a voltaic cell) uses a spontaneous chemical reaction to generate electricity. To accomplish this, one reagent must be oxidized and another must be reduced. The two cannot be in contact, or electrons would flow directly from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent. Instead, oxidizing and reducing agents are physically separated, and electrons are forced to flow through an external circuit to go from one reactant to the other. Batteries ${ }^{7}$ and fuel cells ${ }^{8}$ are galvanic cells that consume their reactants to generate electricity. A battery has a static compartment filled with reactants. In a fuel cell, fresh reactants flow past the electrodes and products are continuously flushed from the cell.

## A Cell in Action

Figure 13-4 shows a galvanic cell with two electrodes suspended in a solution of $\mathrm{CdCl}_{2}$. One electrode is cadmium; the other is metallic silver coated with solid AgCl . The reactions are

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
\text { Reduction: } & 2 \mathrm{AgCl}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \\
\text { Oxidation: } & \frac{\mathrm{Cd}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}}{\mathrm{Cd}(s)+2 \mathrm{AgCl}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)}
\end{array}
$$

The net reaction is composed of a reduction and an oxidation, each of which is called a halfreaction. The two half-reactions are written with equal numbers of electrons so that their sum includes no free electrons.

Oxidation of Cd metal to $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ (aq) provides electrons that flow through the circuit to the Ag electrode in Figure 13-4. At the Ag surface, $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$(from AgCl ) is reduced to $\mathrm{Ag}(s)$. Chloride from AgCl goes into solution. The free energy change for the net reaction, -150 kJ per mole of Cd , provides the driving force that pushes electrons through the circuit.

FIGURE 13-4 A simple galvanic cell. The potentiometer measures voltage. It has positive and negative terminals. When electrons flow into the negative terminal, as in this illustration, the voltage is positive.

## EXAMPLE Voltage Produced by a Chemical Reaction

Calculate the voltage that would be measured by the potentiometer in Figure 13-4.
Solution Because $\Delta G=-150 \mathrm{~kJ}$ per mol of Cd , we can use Equation 13-5 (where $n$ is moles of electrons transferred in the balanced net reaction) to write

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =-\frac{\Delta G}{n F}=-\frac{-150 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}}{(2 \mathrm{~mol})\left(9.649 \times 10^{4} \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~mol}}\right)} \\
& =+0.777 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{C}=+0.777 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Reminder: $1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{C}=1$ volt
A spontaneous chemical reaction (negative $\Delta G$ ) produces a positive voltage.
Test Yourself Find $E$ if $\Delta G=+150 \mathrm{~kJ}$ and $n=1 \mathrm{~mol}$. (Answer: -1.55 V )
Chemists define the electrode at which reduction occurs as the cathode. The anode is the electrode at which oxidation occurs. In Figure 13-4, Ag is the cathode because reduction takes place at its surface $\left(2 \mathrm{AgCl}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Ag}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$, and Cd is the anode because it is oxidized $\left(\mathrm{Cd} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}\right)$.

## Salt Bridge

Consider the cell in Figure 13-5, in which the reactions are intended to be

| Cathode: |  | $2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$ | $\rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)$ |

| Anode: |  | $\mathrm{Cd}(s)$ | $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-}$ |
| Net reaction: | $\mathrm{Cd}(s)+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q)$ | $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)$ |  |

The net reaction is spontaneous, but little current flows through the circuit because $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is not forced to be reduced at the Ag electrode. Aqueous $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$can react directly at the $\mathrm{Cd}(s)$ surface, giving the same net reaction with no flow of electrons through the external circuit.

We can separate the reactants into two half-cells ${ }^{11}$ if we connect the two halves with a salt bridge, as shown in Figure 13-6. The salt bridge is a U-shaped tube filled with a gel containing a high concentration of $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ (or other electrolyte that does not affect the cell reaction). The ends of the bridge are porous glass disks that allow ions to diffuse but minimize mixing of solutions inside and outside the bridge. When the galvanic cell is operating, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the bridge migrates into the cathode compartment and a small amount of $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$migrates from the cathode into the bridge. Ion migration offsets the charge buildup that would otherwise occur as electrons

The cell in Figure 13-5 is short-circuited.

A salt bridge maintains electroneutrality (no charge buildup) throughout the cell. See Demonstration 13-1.

The salt bridge symbol $\|$ represents the two phase boundaries on either side of the bridge.

flow into the silver electrode. The migration of ions out of the bridge is greater than the migration of ions into the bridge because the salt concentration in the bridge is much higher than the salt concentration in the half-cells. At the left side of the salt bridge, $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$migrates into the anode compartment and a little $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ migrates into the bridge to prevent buildup of positive charge.

For reactions that do not involve $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$or other species that react with $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the salt bridge usually contains KCl electrolyte. A typical salt bridge is prepared by heating 3 g of agar with 30 g of KCl in 100 mL of water until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is poured into the U-tube and allowed to gel. The bridge is stored in saturated aqueous KCl.

## Line Notation

Electrochemical cells are described by a notation employing just two symbols:

$$
\text { | phase boundary } \quad \| \text { salt bridge }
$$

The cell in Figure 13-4 is represented by the line diagram

$$
\mathrm{Cd}(s)\left|\mathrm{CdCl}_{2}(a q)\right| \operatorname{AgCl}(s) \mid \operatorname{Ag}(s)
$$

Each phase boundary is indicated by a vertical line. The electrodes are shown at the extreme left- and right-hand sides of the line diagram. The cell in Figure 13-6 is

$$

## DEMONSTRATION 13-1 The Human Salt Bridge

A salt bridge is an ionic medium with a semipermeable barrier on each end. Small molecules and ions can cross a semipermeable barrier, but large molecules cannot. Demonstrate a "proper" salt bridge by filling a U-tube with agar and KCl as described in the text and construct the cell shown here.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e7b9af80-58cf-4034-88b6-5111887f06d8-08.jpg?height=504&width=845&top_left_y=1995&top_left_x=136)

The pH meter is a potentiometer whose negative terminal is the reference electrode socket.

Write the half-reactions for this cell and use the Nernst equation to calculate the theoretical voltage. Measure the voltage with a conventional salt bridge. Then replace the salt bridge with filter paper soaked in NaCl solution and measure the voltage again. Finally, replace the filter-paper salt bridge with two fingers and measure the voltage again. A human is just a bag of salt housed in a semipermeable membrane. Small differences in voltage observed when the salt bridge is replaced can be attributed to the junction potential discussed in Section 14-3. To prove that it is hard to distinguish a chemistry instructor from a hot dog, use a hot dog as a salt bridge ${ }^{9}$ and measure the voltage again.

Challenge One hundred eighty students at Virginia Tech made a salt bridge by holding hands. ${ }^{10}$ Their resistance was lowered from $10^{6} \Omega$ per student to $10^{4} \Omega$ per student by wetting everyone's hands. Can your class beat this record?

## 13-3 Standard Potentials

The voltage measured in Figure 13-6 is the difference in electric potential between the Ag electrode on the right and the Cd electrode on the left. Voltage tells us how much work can be done by electrons flowing from one side to the other (Equation 13-3). The potentiometer (voltmeter) indicates a positive voltage when electrons flow into the negative terminal, as in Figure 13-6. If electrons flow the other way, the voltage is negative.

Sometimes the negative terminal of a voltmeter is labeled "common." It may be colored black and the positive terminal red. When a pH meter with a BNC socket is used as a potentiometer, the center wire is the positive input and the outer connection is the negative input. In older pH meters, the negative terminal is the narrow receptacle to which the reference electrode is connected.

To predict the voltage that will be observed when different half-cells are connected to each other, the standard reduction potential, $E^{\circ}$, for each half-cell is measured by an experiment shown in an idealized form in Figure 13-7. The half-reaction of interest in this diagram is

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)
$$

which occurs in the half-cell at the right connected to the positive terminal of the potentiometer. Standard means that activities of all species are unity. For Reaction 13-10 under standard conditions, $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}=1$ and, by definition, the activity of $\mathrm{Ag}(s)$ also is unity.

The left half-cell, connected to the negative terminal of the potentiometer, is called the standard hydrogen electrode (S.H.E.). It consists of a catalytic Pt surface in contact with an acidic solution in which $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=1$. A stream of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$ bubbled through the electrode saturates the solution with $\mathrm{H}_{2}(a q)$. The activity of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$ is unity if the pressure of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$ is 1 bar. The reaction that comes to equilibrium at the surface of the Pt electrode is
S.H.E. half-reaction: $\quad \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq}, \mathcal{A}=1)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}(g, \mathcal{A}=1)$

We arbitrarily assign a potential of 0 to the standard hydrogen electrode at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The voltage measured by the meter in Figure 13-7 can therefore be assigned to Reaction 13-10, which occurs in the right half-cell. The measured value $E^{\circ}=+0.799 \mathrm{~V}$ is the standard reduction potential for Reaction 13-10. The positive sign tells us that electrons flow from left to right through the meter.

We can arbitrarily assign a potential to Reaction 13-11 because it serves as a reference point from which we can measure other half-cell potentials. An analogy is the arbitrary assignment of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to the freezing point of water. Relative to this freezing point, hexane boils at $69^{\circ}$ and benzene boils at $80^{\circ}$. The difference between boiling points is $80^{\circ}-69^{\circ}=11^{\circ}$. If we were to assign the freezing point of water to be $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ instead of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, hexane would boil at $269^{\circ}$ and benzene would boil at $280^{\circ}$. The difference is still $11^{\circ}$. Regardless of where we set zero on the scale, differences between points remain constant.

Question What is the pH of the standard hydrogen electrode?

We will write all half-reactions as reductions. By convention, $E^{\circ}=0$ for S.H.E.

Walther Nernst appears to have been the first to assign the potential of the hydrogen electrode as 0 in $1897 .{ }^{12}$

Question The potential for the reaction $\mathrm{K}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{K}(s)$ is -2.936 V . This means that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is a very poor oxidizing agent. (It does not readily accept electrons.) Does this imply that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is therefore a good reducing agent?
Answer: No! To be a good reducing agent, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ would have to give up electrons easily (forming $\mathrm{K}^{2+}$ ), which it cannot do. (But, the large negative reduction potential does imply that $K(s)$ is a good reducing agent.)

We always attach the left-hand electrode to the negative terminal of the potentiometer and the right-hand electrode to the positive terminal. The voltage on the meter is the difference:
voltage = right-hand electrode potential - left-hand electrode potential

Challenge Draw a picture of the cell S.H.E $\| \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q, \mathcal{A}=1) \mid \mathrm{Cd}(s)$ and show the direction of electron flow.

A reaction is spontaneous if $\Delta G$ is negative and $E$ is positive. $\Delta G^{\circ}$ and $E^{\circ}$ refer to the free energy change and potential when the activities of reactants and products are unity. $\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}$.

Challenge Show that Le Châtelier's principle requires a negative sign in front of the reaction quotient term in the Nernst equation. Hint: The more favorable a reaction, the more positive is $E$.

The line notation for the cell in Figure 13-7 is

$$
\operatorname{Pt}(s)\left|\mathrm{H}_{2}(g, \mathcal{A}=1)\right| \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q, \mathcal{A}=1) \| \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q, \mathcal{A}=1) \mid \mathrm{Ag}(s)
$$

or

$$
\text { S.H.E. } \| \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q, \mathcal{A}=1) \mid \mathrm{Ag}(s)
$$

By convention, the left-hand electrode (Pt) is attached to the negative (reference) terminal of the potentiometer and the right-hand electrode is attached to the positive terminal. A standard reduction potential is really a potential difference between the potential of the reaction of interest and the potential of S.H.E, which we have arbitrarily set to 0 .

To measure the standard potential of the half-reaction

$$
\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}(s)
$$

we construct the cell

$$
\text { S.H.E. } \| \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}(a q, \mathcal{A}=1) \mid \operatorname{Cd}(s)
$$

with the cadmium half-cell connected to the positive terminal of the potentiometer. In this case, we observe a negative voltage of -0.402 V . The negative sign means that electrons flow from Cd to Pt , a direction opposite that of the cell in Figure 13-7.

Appendix H contains standard reduction potentials arranged alphabetically by element. If the half-reactions were arranged according to descending value of $E^{\circ}$ (as in Table 13-1), we would find the strongest oxidizing agents at the upper left and the strongest reducing agents at the lower right. If we connected the two half-cells represented by Reactions 13-10 and 13-12, $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$would be reduced to $\mathrm{Ag}(s)$ as $\mathrm{Cd}(s)$ is oxidized to $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$.

## 13-4 Nernst Equation

Le Châtelier's principle tells us that increasing reactant concentrations drives a reaction to the right and increasing the product concentrations drives a reaction to the left. The net driving force for a reaction is expressed by the Nernst equation, whose two terms include the driving force under standard conditions ( $E^{\circ}$, which applies when all activities are unity) and a term showing the dependence on reagent concentrations.

## Nernst Equation for a Half-Reaction

For the half-reaction

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+n e^{-} \rightleftharpoons b \mathrm{~B}
$$

the Nernst equation giving the half-cell potential, $E$, is

Nernst equation:

$$
E=E^{\circ}-\frac{R T}{n F} \ln \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a}}
$$

where $E^{\circ}=$ standard reduction potential ( $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}=\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}=1$ )
$R=$ gas constant $(8.314 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{mol})=8.314(\mathrm{~V} \cdot \mathrm{C}) /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{mol}))$
$T=$ temperature (K)
$n=$ number of electrons in the half-reaction
$F=$ Faraday constant $\left(9.649 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}\right)$
$\mathcal{A}_{i}=$ activity of species $i$
The logarithmic term in the Nernst equation is the reaction quotient, $Q$.

$$
Q=\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b} / \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a}
$$

$Q$ has the same form as the equilibrium constant, but the activities need not have their equilibrium values. Pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are omitted from $Q$ because their activities are unity (or close to unity). Concentrations of solutes are expressed as moles per liter and concentrations of gases are expressed as pressures in bars. When all activities are unity, $Q=1$ and $\ln Q=0$, thus giving $E=E^{\circ}$.

Converting the natural logarithm in Equation 13-13 into the base 10 logarithm and inserting $T=298.15 \mathrm{~K}\left(25.00^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ gives the most useful form of the Nernst equation:

Nernst equation at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}: \quad E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916 \mathrm{~V}}{n} \log \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a}}$

The potential changes by $59.16 / n \mathrm{mV}$ for each factor-of-10 change in $Q$.

## EXAMPLE Writing the Nernst Equation for a Half-Reaction

Let's write the Nernst equation for the reduction of white phosphorus to phosphine gas:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{P}_{4}(s, \text { white })+3 \mathrm{H}^{+}+3 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { Phosphine }}{\mathrm{PH}_{3}(g)} \quad E^{\circ}=-0.046 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Solution We omit solids from the reaction quotient, and the concentration of a gas is expressed as the pressure of the gas. Therefore, the Nernst equation is

$$
E=-0.046-\frac{0.05916}{3} \log \frac{P_{\mathrm{PH}_{3}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{3}}
$$

Test Yourself With $E^{\circ}$ from Appendix H , write the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{ZnS}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Zn}(s)+\mathrm{S}^{2-}$. (Answer: $E=-1.405-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left[\mathrm{~S}^{2-}\right]$ )

## EXAMPLE Multiplying a Half-Reaction Does Not Change $\boldsymbol{E}^{\circ}$

If we multiply a half-reaction by any factor, $E^{\circ}$ does not change. However, the factor $n$ before the log term and the form of the reaction quotient, $Q$, do change. Let's write the Nernst equation for the reaction in the preceding example, multiplied by 2 :

$$
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{P}_{4}(s, \text { white })+6 \mathrm{H}^{+}+6 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{PH}_{3}(g) \quad E^{\circ}=-0.046 \mathrm{~V}
$$

## Solution

$$
E=-0.046-\frac{0.05916}{6} \log \frac{P_{\mathrm{PH}_{3}}^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{6}}
$$

Even though this Nernst equation does not look like the one in the preceding example, Box 13-2 shows that the numerical value of $E$ is unchanged. The squared term in the reaction quotient cancels the doubled value of $n$ in front of the log term.

Test Yourself Write the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{P}_{4}+12 \mathrm{H}^{+}+12 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{PH}_{3}$. From

Appendix A shows that $\log x=(\ln x) /(\ln 10) =(\ln x) / 2.303$.

Phosphine is a highly poisonous gas with the odor of decaying fish. Box 13-2, show that $E$ is the same as if the reaction were written with $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{P}_{4}$ or $\frac{1}{4} \mathrm{P}_{4}$.

Multiplying a half-reaction by any number does not change the standard reduction potential, $E^{\circ}$. The potential difference between two points is the work done per coulomb of charge carried through that potential difference ( $E=$ work/ $q$ ). Work per coulomb is the same whether $0.1,2.3$, or $10^{4}$ coulombs have been transferred. The total work is different in each case, but work per coulomb is constant. Therefore, we do not double $E^{\circ}$ if we multiply a half-reaction by 2 .

Multiplying a half-reaction by any number does not change the half-cell potential, E. Consider a half-cell reaction written with either one or two electrons:

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s) \quad E=E^{\circ}-0.05916 \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]}
$$

$$
2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s) \quad E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]^{2}}
$$

The two expressions are equal because $\log a^{b}=b \log a$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]^{2}} & =\frac{\chi \times 0.05916}{\chi} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]} \\
& =0.05916 \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]}
\end{aligned}
$$

The exponent in the log term is canceled by the factor $1 / n$ preceding the log term. Cell voltage is a measurable quantity that cannot depend on how you write the reaction.
$E>0$ : net cell reaction goes →
$E<0$ : net cell reaction goes $\leftarrow$

Pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are omitted from $Q$.

## Nernst Equation for a Complete Reaction

In Figure 13-6, the measured voltage is the difference between the potentials of the two electrodes:

Nernst equation for a complete cell: $\quad E=E_{+}-E_{-}$
where $E_{+}$is the potential of the electrode attached to the positive terminal of the potentiometer and $E_{-}$is the potential of the electrode attached to the negative terminal. The potential of each half-reaction (written as a reduction) is governed by a Nernst equation, and the voltage for the complete reaction is the difference between the two half-cell potentials.

Here is a procedure for writing a net cell reaction and finding its voltage:
Step 1 Write reduction half-reactions for both half-cells and find $E^{\circ}$ for each in Appendix H. Multiply the half-reactions as necessary so that they both contain the same number of electrons. When you multiply a reaction, you do not multiply $E^{\circ}$.

Step 2 Write a Nernst equation for the right half-cell, which is attached to the positive terminal of the potentiometer. This is $E_{+}$.

Step 3 Write a Nernst equation for the left half-cell, which is attached to the negative terminal of the potentiometer. This is $E_{-}$.

Step 4 Find the net cell voltage by subtraction: $E=E_{+}-E_{-}$.
Step 5 Write the net cell reaction by subtracting the left half-reaction from the right halfreaction. (Subtraction is equivalent to reversing the left half-reaction and adding.)

If the net cell voltage, $E\left(=E_{+}-E_{-}\right)$, is positive, then the net cell reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction. If the net cell voltage is negative, then the reaction is spontaneous in the reverse direction.

## EXAMPLE Nernst Equation for a Complete Reaction

Find the voltage of the cell in Figure 13-6 if the right half-cell contains $0.50 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}(a q)$ and the left half-cell contains $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}(a q)$. Write the net cell reaction and state whether it is spontaneous in the forward or reverse direction.

## Solution

Step 1 Right electrode:
Left electrode:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s) \\
& \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}(s)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E_{+}^{\circ}=0.799 \mathrm{~V} \\
& E_{-}^{\circ}=-0.402 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 2 Nernst equation for right electrode:

$$
E_{+}=E_{+}^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]^{2}}=0.799-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{[0.50]^{2}}=0.781 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Step 3 Nernst equation for left electrode:

$$
E_{-}=E_{-}^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}\right]}=-0.402-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{[0.010]}=-0.461 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Step 4 Cell voltage: $\quad E=E_{+}-E_{-}=0.781-(-0.461)=+1.242 \mathrm{~V}$
Step 5 Net cell reaction:

$$
\begin{aligned}
- & 2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s) \\
& \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}(s) \\
\mathrm{Cd}(s)+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}(s) &
\end{aligned}
$$

The voltage is positive, so the reaction is spontaneous in the forward direction. $\operatorname{Cd}(s)$ is oxidized and $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is reduced. Electrons flow from the left-hand electrode to the right-hand electrode.

Test Yourself Is the reaction spontaneous if the cells contain $5.0 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ and $1.0 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ ? (Answer: $E_{+}=0.485 \mathrm{~V}, E_{-}=-0.402 \mathrm{~V}, E=+0.887 \mathrm{~V}$, spontaneous)

What if you had written the Nernst equation for the right half-cell with just one electron instead of two?

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)
$$

Would the net cell voltage be different from what we calculated? It better not be, because the chemistry is still the same. Box 13-2 shows that neither $E^{\circ}$ nor $E$ depend on how we write the reaction. Box 13-3 shows how to derive standard reduction potentials for half-reactions that are the sum of other half-reactions.

## An Intuitive Way to Think About Cell Potentials ${ }^{\mathbf{2}}$

In the preceding example, we found that $E$ for the silver half-cell was 0.781 V and $E$ for the cadmium half-cell was -0.461 V . Place these values on the number line in Figure 13-8 and note that electrons always flow toward more positive potential. Therefore, electrons in the circuit flow from cadmium to silver. The separation of the two half-cells is 1.242 V . This diagram works the same way even if both half-cell potentials are positive or both are negative. Electrons always flow toward more positive potential.

## Different Descriptions of the Same Reaction

In Figure 13-4, the right half-reaction can be written

$$
\begin{gathered}
\operatorname{AgCl}(s)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \operatorname{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=0.222 \mathrm{~V} \\
E_{+}=E_{+}^{\circ}-0.05916 \log \left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]=0.222-0.05916 \log (0.0334)=0.309_{3} \mathrm{~V}
\end{gathered}
$$

The $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in the silver half-reaction was derived from $0.0167 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{CdCl}_{2}(a q)$.
Suppose that a different, less handsome, author had written this book and had chosen to describe the half-reaction differently:

$$
\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s) \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=0.799 \mathrm{~V}
$$

This description is just as valid as the previous one. In both cases, $\operatorname{Ag}(\mathrm{I})$ is reduced to $\operatorname{Ag}(0)$.

Subtracting a reaction is the same as reversing the reaction and adding.

## BOX 13-3 Latimer Diagrams: How to Find $\boldsymbol{E}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ for a New Half-Reaction

A Latimer diagram displays standard reduction potentials, $E^{\circ}$, connecting various oxidation states of an element. ${ }^{13}$ For example, in acid solution, the following standard reduction potentials are observed:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e7b9af80-58cf-4034-88b6-5111887f06d8-14.jpg?height=268&width=901&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=105)

The notation $\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-} \xrightarrow{+1.154} \mathrm{HOI}$ stands for the balanced equation

$$
\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}+5 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HOI}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad E^{\circ}=+1.154 \mathrm{~V}
$$

We can derive reduction potentials for arrows that are not shown in the diagram by using $\Delta G^{\circ}$. For example, the reaction shown by the dashed line in the Latimer diagram is

$$
\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}+6 \mathrm{H}^{+}+6 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{I}^{-}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

To find $E^{\circ}$ for this reaction, express the reaction as a sum of reactions whose potentials are known.

The standard free energy change, $\Delta G^{\circ}$, for a reaction is given by

$$
\Delta G^{\circ}=-n F E^{\circ}
$$

When two reactions are added, $\Delta G^{\circ}$ is the sum of $\Delta G^{\circ}$ values for each reaction.

To apply free energy to our problem, we write reactions whose sum is the desired reaction:

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}+6 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 \mathrm{e}^{-} \xrightarrow{E_{1}^{\circ}=1.210} \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \Delta G_{1}^{\circ}=-5 F(1.210) \\
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{e}^{-} \xrightarrow{E_{2}^{\circ}=0.535} \mathrm{I}^{-} & \Delta G_{2}^{\circ}=-1 F(0.535) \\
\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}+6 \mathrm{H}^{+}+6 \mathrm{e}^{-} \xrightarrow{E_{3}^{\circ}=?} \mathrm{I}^{-}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \Delta G_{3}^{\circ}=-6 F E_{3}^{\circ}
\end{array}
$$

But, because $\Delta G_{1}^{\circ}+\Delta G_{2}^{\circ}=\Delta G_{3}^{\circ}$, we can solve for $E_{3}^{\circ}$ :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta G_{3}^{\circ}=\Delta \mathrm{G}_{1}^{\circ}+\Delta \mathrm{G}_{2}^{\circ} \\
-6 F E_{3}^{\circ}=-5 F(1.210)-1 F(0.535) \\
E_{3}^{\circ}=\frac{5(1.210)+1(0.535)}{6}=1.098 \mathrm{~V}
\end{gathered}
$$

$K_{\mathrm{sp}}=\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$

The cell voltage cannot depend on how we write the reaction!

How to figure out the half-cell reactions

If the two descriptions are equally valid, then they should predict the same voltage. The Nernst equation for Reaction 13-19 is

$$
E_{+}=0.799-0.05916 \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]}
$$

To find the concentration of $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$, we use the solubility product for AgCl . Because the cell contains $0.0334 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and solid AgCl , we can say

$$
\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right]=\frac{K_{\mathrm{sp}}(\text { for } \mathrm{AgCl})}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]}=\frac{1.8 \times 10^{-10}}{0.0334}=5.4 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}
$$

Putting this value into the Nernst equation gives

$$
E_{+}=0.799-0.05916 \log \frac{1}{5.4 \times 10^{-9}}=0.309_{9} \mathrm{~V}
$$

which differs slightly from the value in Equation 13-18 because of the accuracy of $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ and the neglect of activity coefficients. Reactions 13-17 and 13-19 give the same voltage in the Nernst equation because they describe the same cell.

## Advice for Finding Relevant Half-Reactions

When faced with a cell drawing or a line diagram, first write reduction reactions for each halfcell. To do this, look in the cell for an element in two oxidation states. For the cell

$$
\mathrm{Pb}(s)\left|\mathrm{PbF}_{2}(s)\right| \mathrm{F}^{-}(a q) \| \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(a q) \mid \mathrm{Cu}(s)
$$

we see Pb in two oxidation states, as $\mathrm{Pb}(s)$ and $\mathrm{PbF}_{2}(s)$, and Cu in two oxidation states, as $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Cu}(s)$. Thus, the half-reactions are

Right half-cell:

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cu}(s)
$$

Left half-cell:

$$
\mathrm{PbF}_{2}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}(s)+2 \mathrm{~F}^{-}
$$

You might have chosen to write the Pb half-reaction as
Left half-cell:

$$
\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}(s)
$$

because you know that if $\mathrm{PbF}_{2}(s)$ is present, there must be some $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ in the solution. Reactions 13-20 and 13-21 are equally valid and must predict the same cell voltage. Your choice of reactions depends on whether the $\mathrm{F}^{-}$or $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ concentration is easier to figure out.

We described the left half-cell in terms of a redox reaction involving Pb because Pb is the element that appears in two oxidation states. We would not write a reaction such as $\mathrm{F}_{2}(g)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{~F}^{-}$because $\mathrm{F}_{2}(g)$ is not shown in the line diagram of the cell.

## The Nernst Equation Is Used in Measuring Standard Reduction Potentials

The standard reduction potential would be observed if the half-cell of interest (with unit activities) were connected to a standard hydrogen electrode, as it is in Figure 13-7. It is nearly impossible to construct such a cell, because we have no way to adjust concentrations and ionic strength to give unit activities. In reality, activities less than unity are used in each half-cell, and the Nernst equation is employed to extract the value of $E^{\circ}$ from the cell voltage. ${ }^{14}$ In the hydrogen electrode, standard buffers with known pH (Table 14-3) are used to obtain known activities of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

## 13-5 $E^{\circ}$ and the Equilibrium Constant

A galvanic cell produces electricity because the cell reaction is not at equilibrium. The potentiometer allows negligible current (Box 13-4), so concentrations in the cell remain unchanged. If we replaced the potentiometer with a wire, there would be much more current and concentrations would change until the cell reached equilibrium. At that point, nothing would drive the reaction, and $E$ would be 0 . When a battery (which is a galvanic cell) runs down to 0 V , the chemicals inside have reached equilibrium and the battery is "dead."

Now let's relate $E$ for a whole cell to the reaction quotient, $Q$, for the net cell reaction. For the two half-reactions

Right electrode:

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+n \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}
$$

$E_{+}^{\circ}$
Left electrode:

$$
d \mathrm{D}+n \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons b \mathrm{~B}
$$

At equilibrium, $E\left(\operatorname{not} E^{\circ}\right)=0$.

Net cell reaction:
$a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}$
the Nernst equation looks like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E=E_{+}-E_{-}=E_{+}^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{C}}^{c}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a}}-\left(E_{-}^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{D}}^{d}}\right) \\
& E=\underbrace{\left(E_{+}^{\circ}-E_{-}^{\circ}\right)}_{E^{\circ}}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \underbrace{\frac{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{C}}^{c} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{D}}^{d}}{\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a} \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b}}}_{Q}=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log Q
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation 13-22 is true at any time. In the special case when the cell is at equilibrium, $E=0$ and $Q=K$, the equilibrium constant. Therefore, Equation 13-22 is transformed into these most important forms at equilibrium:

Finding $E^{\circ}$ from $K$ :

$$
E^{\circ}=\frac{0.05916}{n} \log K \quad\left(\text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

Finding $K$ from $E^{\circ}$ :

$$
K=10^{n E^{\circ} / 0.05916} \quad\left(\text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
$$

Equation 13-24 allows us to deduce the equilibrium constant from $E^{\circ}$. Alternatively, we can find $E^{\circ}$ from $K$ with Equation 13-23.

Don't invent species not shown in the cell. Use what is shown in the line diagram to select the half-reactions.

Problem 13-20 gives an example of the use of the Nernst equation to find $E^{\circ}$.

To go from Equation 13-23 to 13-24:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{0.05916}{n} \log K & =E^{\circ} \\
\log K & =\frac{n E^{\circ}}{0.05916} \\
10^{\log K} & =10^{n E^{\circ} / 0.05916} \\
K & =10^{n E^{\circ} / 0.05916}
\end{aligned}
$$

## BOX 13-4 Concentrations in the Operating Cell

Why doesn't operation of a cell change the concentrations in the cell? Cell voltage is measured under conditions of negligible current flow. The resistance of a high-quality pH meter is $10^{13} \Omega$. If a cell produces 1 V , the current through the circuit is

$$
I=\frac{E}{R}=\frac{1 \mathrm{~V}}{10^{13} \Omega}=10^{-13} \mathrm{~A}
$$

The electron flow is

$$
\frac{10^{-13} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{s}}{9.649 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol}}=10^{-18} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{s}
$$

which produces negligible oxidation and reduction of reagents in the cell. The meter measures the voltage of the cell without affecting concentrations in the cell.

If a salt bridge were left in a real cell for very long, concentrations and ionic strength would change because of diffusion between each compartment and the salt bridge. Cells should be set up for such a short time that mixing is insignificant.

## EXAMPLE Using $\mathbf{E}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ to Find the Equilibrium Constant

Find the equilibrium constant for the reaction

$$
\mathrm{Cu}(s)+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}
$$

Solution Divide the reaction into two half-reactions found in Appendix H:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} & E_{+}^{\circ}=0.771 \mathrm{~V} \\
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cu}(s) & E_{-}^{\circ}=0.339 \mathrm{~V} \\
\cline { 1 - 1 } \mathrm{Cu}^{\circ}(s)+2 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} &
\end{aligned}
$$

We associate $E^{\circ}$ - with the half-reaction that must be reversed to get the desired net reaction.

Significant figures for logs and exponents were discussed in Section 3-2.
$E^{\circ}$ for dissolution of iron(II) carbonate is negative, which means that the reaction is "not spontaneous." "Not spontaneous" simply means $K<1$. The reaction proceeds until the concentrations of reactants and products satisfy the equilibrium condition.

Possible structure of Ni (glycine) ${ }_{2}$

Then find $E^{\circ}$ for the net reaction

$$
E^{\circ}=E_{+}^{\circ}-E_{-}^{\circ}=0.771-0.339=0.432 \mathrm{~V}
$$

and compute the equilibrium constant with Equation 13-24:

$$
K=10^{(2)(0.432) /(0.05916)}=4 \times 10^{14}
$$

A modest value of $E^{\circ}$ produces a large equilibrium constant. The value of $K$ is correctly expressed with one significant figure, because $E^{\circ}$ has three digits. Two are used for the exponent (14), and one is left for the multiplier (4).

Test Yourself Find $K$ for the reaction $\mathrm{Cu}(s)+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$. (Answer: $E^{\circ}=0.460 \mathrm{~V}, K=4 \times 10^{15}$ )

## Finding $\boldsymbol{K}$ for Net Reactions That Are Not Redox Reactions

Consider the following half-reactions whose difference is the solubility reaction for iron(II) carbonate (which is not a redox reaction):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{FeCO}_{3}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}(s)+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-} \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=-0.756 \mathrm{~V} \\
& \frac{\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Fe}(s)}{\underset{\substack{\mathrm{FeCO}_{3}(s) \\
\text { Iron(II) } \\
\text { carbonate }}}{ } \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}} \quad \frac{E_{-}^{\circ}=-0.44 \mathrm{~V}}{E^{\circ}=-0.756-(-0.44)}=-0.31_{6} \mathrm{~V} \\
& K=K_{\mathrm{sp}}=10^{(2)\left(-0.31_{6}\right) /(0.05916)}=10^{-11}
\end{aligned}
$$

From $E^{\circ}$ for the net reaction, we can compute $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ for iron(II) carbonate. Potentiometric measurements allow us to find equilibrium constants that are too small or too large to measure by determining concentrations of reactants and products directly.
"Wait!" you protest. "How can there be a redox potential for a reaction that is not a redox reaction?" Box 13-3 shows that the redox potential is just another way of expressing the free energy change of the reaction. The more energetically favorable the reaction (the more negative $\Delta G^{\circ}$ ), the more positive is $E^{\circ}$.

The general form of a problem involving the relation between $E^{\circ}$ values for half-reactions and $K$ for a net reaction is

| Half-reaction: | $E_{+}^{\circ}$ |
| ---: | :--- |
| Half-reaction: | $E_{-}^{\circ}$ |
| Net reaction: | $E^{\circ}=E_{+}^{\circ}-E_{-}^{\circ}$ |$\quad K=10^{n E^{\circ} / 0.05916}$

If you know $E_{-}^{\circ}$ and $E_{+}^{\circ}$, you can find $E^{\circ}$ and $K$ for the net cell reaction. Alternatively, if you know $E^{\circ}$ and either $E_{-}^{\circ}$ or $E_{+}^{\circ}$, you can find the missing standard potential. If you know $K$, you can calculate $E^{\circ}$ and use it to find either $E_{-}^{\circ}$ or $E_{+}^{\circ}$, provided you know one of them.

## EXAMPLE Relating $\boldsymbol{E}^{\circ}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}$

From the formation constant of $\mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2}$ plus $E^{\circ}$ for the $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+} \mid \mathrm{Ni}(s)$ couple,

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}+2 \text { glycine }{ }^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2} & K \equiv \beta_{2}=1.2 \times 10^{11} \\
\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(s) & E^{\circ}=-0.236 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

deduce the value of $E^{\circ}$ for the reaction

$$
\mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(s)+2 \text { glycine }^{-}
$$

Solution We need to see the relations among the three reactions:

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(s) & & E_{+}^{\circ}=-0.236 \mathrm{~V} \\
-\mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(s)+2 \text { glycine }^{-} & & E_{-}^{\circ}=? \\
\cline { 1 - 1 } \mathrm{Ni}^{2+}+2 \text { glycine }^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2} & & E^{\circ}=? \quad K=1.2 \times 10^{11}
\end{array}
$$

We know that $E_{+}^{\circ}-E_{-}^{\circ}$ must equal $E^{\circ}$, so we can deduce the value of $E_{-}^{\circ}$ if we can find $E^{\circ}$. But $E^{\circ}$ can be determined from the equilibrium constant for the net reaction:

$$
E^{\circ}=\frac{0.05916}{n} \log K=\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(1.2 \times 10^{11}\right)=0.328 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Hence, the standard reduction potential for half-reaction 13-25 is

$$
E_{-}^{\circ}=E_{+}^{\circ}-E^{\circ}=-0.236-0.328=-0.564 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Test Yourself Select half-reactions in Appendix H to find the formation constant $\beta_{2}$ for $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}+2$ ethylenediamine $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Cu}(\text { ethylenediamine })_{2}^{+}$. (Answer: $E^{\circ}=0.637 \mathrm{~V}$, $\beta_{2}=6 \times 10^{10}$ )

## 13-6 Cells as Chemical Probes ${ }^{15}$

It is essential to distinguish two classes of equilibria associated with galvanic cells:

1. Equilibrium between the two half-cells
2. Equilibrium within each half-cell

If a galvanic cell has a nonzero voltage, then the net cell reaction is not at equilibrium. We say that equilibrium between the two half-cells has not been established.

We allow half-cells to stand long enough to come to chemical equilibrium within each half-cell. For example, in the right-hand half-cell in Figure 13-9, the reaction

$$
\operatorname{AgCl}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)
$$

is at equilibrium. It is not part of the net cell reaction. It simply occurs when $\mathrm{AgCl}(s)$ is in contact with water. In the left half-cell, the reaction

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

has also come to equilibrium. Neither reaction is part of the net cell redox reaction.

FIGURE 13-9 This galvanic cell can be used to measure the pH of the left half-cell.

The more negative potential of -0.564 V for reducing Ni (glycine) ${ }_{2}$ compared to -0.236 V for reducing $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ tells us that it is harder to reduce $\mathrm{Ni}(\text { glycine })_{2}$ than $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$. $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ is stabilized with respect to reduction by complexation with glycine.

A chemical reaction that occurs within one half-cell will reach equilibrium and is assumed to remain at equilibrium. Such a reaction is not the net cell reaction.

Question Why can we assume that the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are equal to their initial (formal) concentrations?

Half-reactions that you write must involve species that appear in two oxidation states in the cell.

The redox reaction for the right half-cell of Figure 13-9 is

$$
\mathrm{AgCl}(s)+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q, 0.10 \mathrm{M}) \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=0.222 \mathrm{~V}
$$

But what is the reaction in the left half-cell? The only element we find in two oxidation states is hydrogen. We see that $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)$ bubbles into the cell, and we also realize that every aqueous solution contains $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Therefore, hydrogen is present in two oxidation states, and the halfreaction can be written as

$$
2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q, ? \mathrm{M})+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2}(g, 1.00 \text { bar }) \quad E_{-}^{\circ}=0
$$

The net cell reaction is not at equilibrium, because the measured voltage is 0.503 V , not 0 V .
The Nernst equation for the net cell reaction is

$$
E=E_{+}-E_{-}=\left(0.222-0.05916 \log \left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]\right)-\left(0-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}}\right)
$$

After inserting the known quantities, we discover that the only unknown is $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. The measured voltage therefore allows us to find [ $H^{+}$] in the left half-cell:

$$
\begin{gathered}
0.503=(0.222-0.05916 \log [0.10])-\left(0-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1.00}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}}\right) \\
\Rightarrow\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.8 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}
\end{gathered}
$$

This, in turn, allows us to evaluate the equilibrium constant for the acid-base reaction that has come to equilibrium in the left half-cell:

$$
K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right]}=\frac{(0.0050)\left(1.8 \times 10^{-4}\right)}{0.050}=1.8 \times 10^{-5}
$$

The cell in Figure 13-9 acts as a probe to measure [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] in the left half-cell. Using this type of cell, we could determine the equilibrium constant for acid dissociation or base hydrolysis in the left half-cell.

## Survival Tips

Problems in this chapter include some brainbusters designed to bring together your knowledge of electrochemistry, chemical equilibrium, solubility, complex formation, and acid-base chemistry. They require you to find the equilibrium constant for a reaction that occurs in only one half-cell. The reaction of interest is not the net cell reaction and is not a redox reaction. Here is a good approach:

Step 1 Write the two half-reactions and their standard potentials. If you choose a halfreaction for which you cannot find $E^{\circ}$, then find another way to write the reaction.

Step 2 Write a Nernst equation for the net reaction and put in all the known quantities. If all is well, there will be only one unknown in the equation.

Step 3 Solve for the unknown concentration and use that concentration to solve the chemical equilibrium problem that was originally posed.

## EXAMPLE Analyzing a Very Complicated Cell

The cell in Figure 13-10 measures the formation constant $\left(K_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ of $\operatorname{Hg}(\mathrm{EDTA})^{2-}$. The right-hand compartment contains 0.500 mmol of $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ and 2.00 mmol of EDTA in 0.100 L buffered to pH 6.00 . The voltage is +0.342 V . Find the value of $K_{\mathrm{f}}$ for $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{EDTA})^{2-}$.

## Solution

Step 1 The left half-cell is a standard hydrogen electrode for which we can say $E_{-}=0$. In the right half-cell, mercury is in two oxidation states. So let's write the half-reaction

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Hg}^{2+} & +2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}(l) \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=0.852 \mathrm{~V} \\
E_{+} & =0.852-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e7b9af80-58cf-4034-88b6-5111887f06d8-19.jpg?height=738&width=975&top_left_y=105&top_left_x=390)

In the right half-cell, the reaction between $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ and EDTA is

$$
\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}+\mathrm{Y}^{4-} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{f}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{HgY}^{2-}
$$

Because we expect $K_{\mathrm{f}}$ to be large, we assume that virtually all the $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ has reacted to make $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$. Therefore, the concentration of $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$ is $0.500 \mathrm{mmol} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}=$ 0.00500 M . The remaining EDTA has a total concentration of (2.00-0.50) $\mathrm{mmol} / 100 \mathrm{~mL}=0.0150 \mathrm{M}$. The right-hand compartment therefore contains $0.00500 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HgY}^{2-}, 0.0150 \mathrm{M}$ EDTA, and a small, unknown concentration of $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$.

The formation constant for $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$ can be written

$$
K_{\mathrm{f}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right] \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}[\text { EDTA }]}
$$

where [EDTA] is the formal concentration of EDTA not bound to metal. In this cell, $[$ EDTA $]=0.0150 \mathrm{M}$. The fraction of EDTA in the form $\mathrm{Y}^{4-}$ is $\alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}$ (Section 11-2). Because we know that $\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]=0.00500 \mathrm{M}$, all we need to find is [ $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$ ] in order to evaluate $K_{\mathrm{f}}$.
Step 2 The Nernst equation for the net cell reaction is

$$
E=0.342=E_{+}-E_{-}=\left[0.852-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]}\right)\right]-(0)
$$

in which the only unknown is $\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]$.
Step 3 Now we solve the Nernst equation to find $\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]=5.7 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{M}$, and this value of $\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right]$ allows us to evaluate the formation constant for $\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{\mathrm{f}} & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{HgY}^{2-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right] \alpha_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}[\mathrm{EDTA}]}=\frac{(0.00500)}{\left(5.7 \times 10^{-18}\right)\left(1.8 \times 10^{-5}\right)(0.0150)} \\
& =3 \times 10^{21}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mixture of EDTA plus $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{EDTA})^{2-}$ in the cathode serves as a mercuric ion "buffer" that fixes the concentration of $\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}$. This concentration, in turn, determines the cell voltage.

Test Yourself Find $K_{\mathrm{f}}$ if the cell voltage had been 0.300 V. (Answer: $8 \times 10^{22}$ )

## 13-7 Biochemists Use $\boldsymbol{E}^{\circ \prime}$

In respiration, molecules from food are oxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to yield energy or metabolic intermediates. The standard reduction potentials that we have been using so far apply to systems in which all activities of reactants and products are unity. If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is involved in the reaction,

FIGURE 13-10 A galvanic cell that can be used to measure the formation constant for $\mathrm{Hg}(\text { EDTA })^{2-}$.

Recall that $\left[\mathrm{Y}^{4-}\right]=\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{\mathrm{Y}^{4-}}[$ EDTA $]$.
$\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{Y^{4}}$ - comes from Table 11-1.

$E^{\circ}$ applies when $\mathrm{pH}=0\left(\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}=1\right)$. Whenever $H^{+}$appears in a redox reaction, or whenever reactants or products are acids or bases, reduction potentials are pH dependent.

Because the pH inside a plant or animal cell is about 7 , reduction potentials that apply at pH 0 are not particularly appropriate. For example, at pH 0 , ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) is a more powerful reducing agent than succinic acid. However, at pH 7 , this order is reversed. It is the reducing strength at pH 7 , not at pH 0 , that is relevant to a living cell.

The standard potential for a redox reaction is defined for a galvanic cell in which all activities are unity. The formal potential is the reduction potential that applies under a specified set of conditions (including pH , ionic strength, and concentration of complexing agents). Biochemists call the formal potential at $\mathrm{pH} 7 \boldsymbol{E}^{\circ \prime}$ (read " $E$ zero prime"). Table 13-2 lists $E^{\circ \prime}$ values for some biological redox couples.

## Relation Between $\boldsymbol{E}^{\circ}$ and $\boldsymbol{E}^{\circ \prime}$

Consider the half-reaction

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+n \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons b \mathrm{~B}+m \mathrm{H}^{+} \quad E^{\circ}
$$

in which A is an oxidized species and B is a reduced species. Both A and B might be acids or bases, as well. The Nernst equation for this half-reaction is

$$
E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \frac{[\mathrm{~B}]^{b}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{m}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{a}}
$$

To find $E^{\circ \prime}$, we rearrange the Nernst equation to a form in which the log term contains only the formal concentrations of A and B raised to the powers $a$ and $b$, respectively.

Recipe for $E^{\circ \prime}$ :

$$
E=\underbrace{E^{\circ}+\text { other terms }}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { All of this is called } E^{\circ \prime} \\
\text { when } \mathrm{pH}=7
\end{array}}-\frac{0.05916}{n} \log \frac{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{B}}^{b}}{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{A}}^{a}}
$$

The entire collection of terms over the brace, evaluated at $\mathrm{pH}=7$, is called $E^{\circ \prime}$.
To convert $[\mathrm{A}]$ or $[\mathrm{B}]$ into $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}}$ or $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{B}}$, we use fractional composition equations (Section 9-5), which relate the formal (that is, total) concentration of all forms of an acid or a base to its concentration in a particular form:

Monoprotic system:

Diprotic system:

$$
\begin{gathered}
{[\mathrm{HA}]=\alpha_{\mathrm{HA}} \mathrm{~F}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \mathrm{F}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+K_{\mathrm{a}}}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{~A}^{-}\right]=\alpha_{\mathrm{A}^{-}} \mathrm{F}=\frac{K_{\mathrm{a}} \mathrm{~F}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+K_{\mathrm{a}}}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}\right]=\alpha_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}} \mathrm{~F}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2} \mathrm{~F}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}+\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{HA}^{-}\right]=\alpha_{\mathrm{HA}^{-}} \mathrm{F}=\frac{K_{1}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \mathrm{F}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}+\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{~A}^{2-}\right]=\alpha_{\mathrm{A}^{2-}} \mathrm{F}=\frac{K_{1} K_{2} \mathrm{~F}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}+\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

where F is the formal concentration of HA or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}, K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the acid dissociation constant for HA , and $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ are the acid dissociation constants for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}$.

One way to measure $E^{\circ \prime}$ is to establish a half-cell in which the formal concentrations of the oxidized and reduced species are equal and the pH is adjusted to 7 . Then the log term in Equation 13-26 is zero and the measured potential (versus S.H.E.) is $E^{\circ \prime}$.

## EXAMPLE Calculating the Formal Potential

Find $E^{\circ \prime}$ for the reaction
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e7b9af80-58cf-4034-88b6-5111887f06d8-21.jpg?height=385&width=1066&top_left_y=1499&top_left_x=310)

Solution Abbreviating dehydroascorbic acid ${ }^{16}$ as D , and ascorbic acid as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}$, we rewrite the reduction as

$$
\mathrm{D}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

for which the Nernst equation is

$$
E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}\right]}{[\mathrm{D}]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}}
$$

D is not an acid or a base, so its formal concentration equals its molar concentration: $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{D}}=[\mathrm{D}]$. For the diprotic acid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}$, we use Equation 13-29 to express $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}\right]$ in terms of $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}}$ :

$$
\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}\right]=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2} \mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}+\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}
$$

If we had included activity coefficients, they would appear in $E^{\prime \prime}$ also.

For a monoprotic acid:

$$
\mathrm{F}=[\mathrm{HA}]+\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]
$$

For a diprotic acid:

$$
F=\left[H_{2} A\right]+\left[H A^{-}\right]+\left[A^{2-}\right]
$$

Putting these values into Equation 13-33 gives

$$
E=E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \left(\frac{\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2} \mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2+}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}}{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{D}}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}}\right)
$$

which can be rearranged to the form

$$
E=\underbrace{E^{\circ}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2+}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K_{1}+K_{1} K_{2}}}_{\substack{\text { Formal potential }\left(=E^{\circ \circ} \text { if } \mathrm{pH}=7\right) \\=+0.062 \mathrm{~V}}}-\frac{0.05916}{2} \log \frac{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}}}{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{D}}}
$$

Putting the values of $E^{\circ}, K_{1}$, and $K_{2}$ into Equation 13-34 and setting $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{-7.00}$, we find $E^{\circ \prime}=+0.062 \mathrm{~V}$.

Test Yourself Compute $E^{\circ \prime}$ for the reaction $\mathrm{O}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. (Answer: 0.815 V )

Curve $a$ in Figure 13-11 shows how the calculated formal potential for Reaction 13-32 depends on pH . The potential decreases as the pH increases, until $\mathrm{pH} \approx \mathrm{p} K_{2}$. Above $\mathrm{p} K_{2}, \mathrm{~A}^{2-}$ is the dominant form of ascorbic acid, and no protons are involved in the net redox reaction. Therefore, the potential becomes independent of pH .

A biological example of $E^{\circ \prime}$ is the reduction of Fe (III) in the protein transferrin. This protein has two Fe (III)-binding sites, one in each half of the molecule designated C and N for the carboxyl and amino terminals of the peptide chain. Transferrin carries Fe(III) through the blood to cells that require iron. Membranes of these cells have a receptor that binds Fe (III)-transferrin and takes it into a compartment called an endosome into which $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is pumped to lower the pH to $\sim 5.8$. Iron is released from transferrin in the endosome and continues into the cell as Fe (II) attached to an intracellular metal-transport protein.

FIGURE 13-11 Reduction potential of ascorbic acid, showing its dependence on pH . (a) Graph of the function labeled formal potential in Equation 13-34. (b) Experimental polarographic half-wave reduction potential of ascorbic acid in a medium of ionic strength $=0.2 \mathrm{M}$. The half-wave potential (Chapter 16) is nearly the same as the formal potential. At high $\mathrm{pH}(>12)$, the half-wave potential does not level off to a slope of 0, as Equation 13-34 predicts. Instead, a hydrolysis reaction of ascorbic acid occurs and the chemistry is more complex than Reaction 13-32. [From J. J. Ruiz, A. Aldaz, and M. Dominguez, Can. J. Chem. 1977, 55, 2799; ibid. 1978, 56, 1533.]

The entire cycle of transferrin uptake, metal removal, and transferrin release back to the bloodstream takes $1-2 \mathrm{~min}$. The time required for Fe (III) to dissociate from transferrin at pH 5.8 is $\sim 6 \mathrm{~min}$, which is too long to account for release in the endosome. The reduction potential of Fe (III)-transferrin at pH 5.8 is $E^{\circ \prime}=-0.52 \mathrm{~V}$, which is too low for physiologic reductants.

The mystery of how Fe(III) is released from transferrin in the endosome was solved by measuring $E^{\circ \prime}$ for the Fe (III)-transferrin-receptor complex at pH 5.8 . To simplify the chemistry, transferrin was cleaved and only the C-terminal half of the protein (designated $\operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}$ ) was used. Figure 13-12 shows measurements of $\log \left\{\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) \operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II}) \operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}\right]\right\}$ for free protein and for the protein-receptor complex. In Equation 13-26, $E=E^{\circ \prime}$ when the log term is zero (that is, when $\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) \operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}\right]=\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II}) \operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}\right]$ ). Figure 13-12 shows that $E^{\circ \prime}$ for Fe (III) $\operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}$ is near -0.50 V , but $E^{\circ \prime}$ for the Fe (III) $\operatorname{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}$-receptor complex is -0.29 V . The reducing agents NADH and NADPH in Table 13-2 are strong enough to reduce $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III}) \mathrm{Trf}_{\mathrm{C}}$ bound to its receptor at pH 5.8 , but not strong enough to reduce free Fe(III)-transferrin.

## Summary

Work done when a charge of $q$ coulombs passes through a potential difference of $E$ volts is work $=E \cdot q$. The maximum work that can be done on the surroundings by a spontaneous chemical reaction is related to the free energy change for the reaction: work $=-\Delta G$. If the chemical change produces a potential difference, $E$, the relation between free energy and the potential difference is $\Delta G=-n F E$. Ohm's law $(I=E / R)$ describes the relation between current, voltage, and resistance in an electric circuit. It can be combined with the definitions of work and power ( $P=$ work per second) to give $P=E \cdot I=I^{2} R$.

A galvanic cell uses a spontaneous redox reaction to produce electricity. The electrode at which oxidation occurs is the anode, and the electrode at which reduction occurs is the cathode. Two halfcells are usually separated by a salt bridge that allows ions to migrate from one side to the other to maintain charge neutrality but prevents reactants in the two half-cells from mixing. The standard reduction potential of a half-reaction is measured by pairing that half-reaction with a standard hydrogen electrode. The term "standard" means that activities of reactants and products are unity. If several half-reactions are added to give another half-reaction, the standard potential of the net half-reaction can be found by equating the free energy of the net half-reaction to the sum of free energies of the component half-reactions.

The voltage for a complete reaction is the difference between the potentials of the two half-reactions: $E=E_{+}-E_{-}$, where $E_{+}$ is the potential of the half-cell connected to the positive terminal of the potentiometer and $E_{-}$is the potential of the half-cell connected to the negative terminal. The potential of each half-reaction is given by the Nernst equation: $E=E^{\circ}-(0.05916 / n) \log Q$ (at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), where each reaction is written as a reduction and $Q$ is the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient has the same form as the equilibrium constant, but it is evaluated with concentrations existing at the time of interest. Electrons flow through the circuit from the electrode with the more negative potential to the electrode with the more positive potential.

Complex equilibria can be studied by making them part of an electrochemical cell. If we measure the voltage and know the concentrations (activities) of all but one of the reactants and products, the Nernst equation allows us to compute the concentration of the unknown species. The electrochemical cell serves as a probe for that species.

Biochemists use the formal potential of a half-reaction at pH 7 ( $E^{\circ \prime}$ ) instead of the standard potential ( $E^{\circ}$ ), which applies at pH 0 . $E^{\circ \prime}$ is found by writing the Nernst equation for the half-reaction and grouping together all terms except the logarithm containing the formal concentrations of reactant and product. The combination of terms, evaluated at pH 7 , is $E^{\circ}$.

13-K. Living cells convert energy derived from sunlight or combustion of food into energy-rich ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
molecules. For ATP synthesis, $\Delta G=+34.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. This energy is then made available to the cell when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). In animals, ATP is synthesized when protons pass through a complex enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane. ${ }^{17}$ Two factors account for the movement of protons through this enzyme into the mitochondrion (see the figure): (1) $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is higher outside the mitochondrion than inside because protons are pumped out of the mitochondrion by enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of food. (2) The inside of the mitochondrion is negatively charged with respect to the outside.
(a) The synthesis of one ATP molecule requires $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$to pass through the phosphorylation enzyme. The difference in free energy when a molecule travels from a region of high activity to a region of low activity is

$$
\Delta G=-R T \ln \frac{\mathcal{A}_{\text {high }}}{\mathcal{A}_{\text {low }}}
$$

How big must the pH difference be (at 298 K ) if the passage of two protons is to provide enough energy to synthesize one ATP molecule?
(b) pH differences this large have not been observed in mitochondria. How great an electric potential difference between inside and outside is necessary for the movement of two protons to provide energy to synthesize ATP? In answering this question, neglect any contribution from the pH difference.
(c) The energy for ATP synthesis is thought to be provided by both the pH difference and the electric potential. If the pH difference is 1.00 pH unit, what is the magnitude of the potential difference?

## Nernst Equation

13-14. What is the difference between $E$ and $E^{\circ}$ for a redox reaction? Which one runs down to 0 when the complete cell comes to equilibrium?

13-15. (a) Use the Nernst equation to write the spontaneous chemical reaction that occurs in the cell in Demonstration 13-1.
(b) If you use your fingers as a salt bridge in Demonstration 13-1, will your body take in $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ?

13-16. Write the Nernst equation for the following half-reaction and find $E$ when $\mathrm{pH}=3.00$ and $P_{\mathrm{AsH}_{3}}=1.0$ mbar.

$$
\mathrm{As}(s)+3 \mathrm{H}^{+}+3 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { Arsine }}{\mathrm{AsH}_{3}(g)} \quad E^{\circ}=-0.238 \mathrm{~V}
$$

13-17. (a) Write the line notation for the following cell.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e7b9af80-58cf-4034-88b6-5111887f06d8-26.jpg?height=654&width=801&top_left_y=1738&top_left_x=1142)
(b) Calculate the potential of each half-cell and the cell voltage, $E$. In which direction will electrons flow through the circuit? Write the spontaneous net cell reaction.

(c) The left half-cell was loaded with 14.3 mL of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(l)$ (density = $3.12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ). The aluminum electrode contains 12.0 g of Al . Which element, $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ or Al , is the limiting reagent? (That is, which reagent will be used up first?)
(d) If the cell is somehow operated under conditions in which it produces a constant voltage of 1.50 V , how much electrical work will have been done when 0.231 mL of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(l)$ has been consumed?
(e) If the potentiometer is replaced by a $1.20-\mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor and if the heat dissipated by the resistor is $1.00 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}$, at what rate (grams per second) is $\mathrm{Al}(s)$ dissolving? (In this question, the voltage is not 1.50 V .)

13-18. A nickel-metal hydride rechargeable battery formerly used in laptop computers is based on the following chemistry:

Cathode:

$$
\mathrm{NiOOH}(s)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \underset{\text { charge }}{\stackrel{\text { discharge }}{\rightleftarrows}} \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s)+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

Anode:

$$
\mathrm{MH}(s)+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \underset{\text { charge }}{\stackrel{\text { discharge }}{\rightleftharpoons}} \mathrm{M}(s)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{e}^{-}
$$

The anode material, MH , is a transition metal hydride or rare earth alloy hydride. Explain why the voltage remains nearly constant during the entire discharge cycle.

13-19. Suppose that the concentrations of NaF and KCl were each 0.10 M in the cell

$$
\operatorname{Pb}(s)\left|\operatorname{PbF}_{2}(s)\right| \mathrm{F}^{-}(a q) \| \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)|\operatorname{AgCl}(s)| \operatorname{Ag}(s)
$$

(a) Using the half-reactions $2 \mathrm{AgCl}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{PbF}_{2}(s)+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}(s)+2 \mathrm{~F}^{-}$, calculate the cell voltage.
(b) By the reasoning in Figure 13-8, in which direction do electrons flow?
(c) Now calculate the cell voltage by using the reactions $2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Ag}(s)$ and $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}(s)$. For this part, you will need the solubility products for $\mathrm{PbF}_{2}$ and AgCl .

13-20. The following cell was set up to measure the standard reduction potential of the $\mathrm{Ag}^{+} \mid \mathrm{Ag}$ couple:

$$
\operatorname{Pt}(s)\left|\mathrm{HCl}(0.01000 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \| \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}(0.01000 \mathrm{M})\right| \mathrm{Ag}(s)

The temperature was $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (the standard condition) and atmospheric pressure was 751.0 Torr. Because the vapor pressure of water is 23.8 Torr at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ in the cell was $751.0-23.8=727.2$ Torr. The Nernst equation for the cell, including activity coefficients, is derived as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Right electrode: } \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}(s) \quad E_{+}^{\circ}=E_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+} \mid \mathrm{Ag}}^{\circ} \\
& \text { Left electrode: } \quad \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \quad E_{-}^{\circ}=0 \mathrm{~V} \\
& E_{+}=E_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+} \mid \mathrm{Ag}}^{\circ}-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right] \gamma_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}}\right) \\
& E_{-}=0-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{1 / 2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \gamma_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}}\right) \\
& E=E_{+}-E_{-}=E_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+} \mid \mathrm{Ag}}^{\circ}-0.05916 \log \left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \gamma_{\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}^{1 / 2}\left[\mathrm{Ag}^{+}\right] \gamma_{\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}}\right)
