Part of the North Branch of the Potomac River runs crystal clear through the scenic Appalachian Mountains, but it is lifeless-a victim of acid drainage from abandoned coal mines. As the river passes a paper mill and a wastewater treatment plant near Westernport, Maryland, the pH rises from an acidic, lethal value of 4.5 to a neutral value of 7.2, at which fish and plants thrive. This happy "accident" comes about because calcium carbonate exiting the paper mill equilibrates with massive quantities of carbon dioxide from bacterial respiration at the sewage treatment plant. The resulting soluble bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic river and restores life downstream of the plant. ${ }^{1}$ In the absence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, solid $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ would be trapped at the treatment plant and would never enter the river.

$$
\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s)+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(a q)+2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q)
$$

## Calcium carbonate trapped at treatment plant

Dissolved calcium bicarbonate enters river and neutralizes acid

$$
\underset{\text { Bicarbonate }}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}(a q) \xrightarrow[\text { Acid in river }]{\text { neutralization }} \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)}
$$

The chemistry that helps the Potomac River endangers coral reefs, which are largely $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$. Burning of fossil fuel has increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the atmosphere from 280 ppm when Captain Cook first sighted the Great Barrier Reef in 1770 to 380 ppm today (Figure 0-6). $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the atmosphere adds $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to the ocean, dissolving $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ from coral. Rising $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and, perhaps, rising atmospheric temperature from the greenhouse effect threaten coral reefs with extinction. ${ }^{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has lowered the average pH of the ocean from its preindustrial value of 8.16 to 8.04 today. ${ }^{3}$ Without changes in man's activities, the pH could be 7.7 by 2100 .

Equation 6-2, the law of mass action, was formulated by the Norwegians C. M. Guldenberg and P. Waage in 1864. Their derivation was based on the idea that the forward and reverse rates of a reaction at equilibrium must be equal. ${ }^{4}$

The equilibrium constant is more correctly expressed as a ratio of activities rather than of concentrations. We reserve the discussion of activity for Chapter 7.

Equilibrium constants are dimensionless.

Equilibrium constants are dimensionless but, when specifying concentrations, you must use units of molarity (M) for solutes and bars for gases.

Throughout this book, assume that all species in chemical equations are in aqueous solution, unless otherwise specified.

If a reaction is reversed, then $K^{\prime}=1 / K$. If two reactions are added, then $K_{3}=K_{1} K_{2}$.

Chemical equilibrium provides a foundation not only for chemical analysis, but also for other subjects such as biochemistry, geology, and oceanography. This chapter introduces equilibria for the solubility of ionic compounds, complex formation, and acid-base reactions.

## 6-1 The Equilibrium Constant

For the reaction

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}
$$

we write the equilibrium constant, $K$, in the form
Equilibrium constant: $\quad K=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]^{c}[\mathrm{D}]^{d}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]^{b}}$
where the lowercase superscript letters denote stoichiometry coefficients and each capital letter stands for a chemical species. The symbol $[\mathrm{A}]$ stands for the concentration of A relative to its standard state (defined next). By definition, a reaction is favored whenever $K>1$.

In the thermodynamic derivation of the equilibrium constant, each quantity in Equation 6-2 is expressed as the ratio of the concentration of a species to its concentration in its standard state. For solutes, the standard state is 1 M . For gases, the standard state is $1 \mathrm{bar}\left(\equiv 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa} ; 1 \mathrm{~atm} \equiv 1.01325 \mathrm{bar}\right)$, and for solids and liquids, the standard states are the pure solid or liquid. It is understood that $[\mathrm{A}]$ in Equation 6-2 really means $[\mathrm{A}] /(1 \mathrm{M})$ if A is a solute. If D is a gas, [ D ] really means (pressure of D in bars)/( 1 bar). To emphasize that $[\mathrm{D}]$ means pressure of D , we usually write $P_{\mathrm{D}}$ in place of $[\mathrm{D}]$. The terms in Equation 6-2 are actually dimensionless; therefore, all equilibrium constants are dimensionless.

For the ratios $[\mathrm{A}] /(1 \mathrm{M})$ and $[\mathrm{D}] /(1$ bar $)$ to be dimensionless, $[\mathrm{A}]$ must be expressed in moles per liter (M), and [D] must be expressed in bars. If C were a pure liquid or solid, the ratio [C]/(concentration of C in its standard state) would be unity (1) because the standard state is the pure liquid or solid. If C is a solvent, the concentration is so close to that of pure liquid C that the value of $[\mathrm{C}]$ is still essentially 1 .

The take-home lesson is this: When you evaluate an equilibrium constant,

1. Concentrations of solutes should be expressed as moles per liter.
2. Concentrations of gases should be expressed in bars.
3. Concentrations of pure solids, pure liquids, and solvents are omitted because they are unity.

These conventions are arbitrary, but you must use them if you wish to use tabulated values of equilibrium constants, standard reduction potentials, and free energies.

## Manipulating Equilibrium Constants

Consider the reaction

$$
\mathrm{HA} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-} \quad K_{1}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}
$$

If the direction of a reaction is reversed, the new value of $K$ is simply the reciprocal of the original value of $K$.

Equilibrium constant for reverse reaction:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HA} \quad K_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{[\mathrm{HA}]}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}=1 / K_{1}
$$

If two reactions are added, the new $K$ is the product of the two individual values:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{HA} & \rightleftharpoons\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+\mathrm{A}^{-} \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+\mathrm{C}} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}^{+} \\
\cline { 1 - 2 } & \mathrm{HA}+\mathrm{C} \\
& \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{~A}^{-}+\mathrm{CH}^{+} \\
& K_{2} \\
& K_{3}
\end{array}
$$

Equilibrium constant for sum of reactions:

$$
K_{3}=K_{1} K_{2}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]} \cdot \frac{\left[\mathrm{CH}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right][\mathrm{C}]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{CH}^{+}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}][\mathrm{C}]}
$$

If $n$ reactions are added, the overall equilibrium constant is the product of $n$ individual equilibrium constants.

## EXAMPLE Combining Equilibrium Constants

The equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is called $K_{\mathrm{w}}\left(=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]\right)$ and has the value $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Given that $K_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}=1.8 \times 10^{-5}$ for the reaction $\mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, find $K$ for the reaction $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

Solution The third reaction can be obtained by reversing the second reaction and adding it to the first reaction:

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH} & & K=K_{\mathrm{w}} \\
\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & & K=1 / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}} \\
\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q) & & K=K_{\mathrm{w}} \cdot \frac{1}{K_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}}=5.6 \times 10^{-10}
\end{array}
$$

Test Yourself For the reaction $\mathrm{Li}^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Li}(\mathrm{OH})(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}, K_{\mathrm{Li}}=2.3 \times 10^{-14}$. Combine this reaction with the $K_{\mathrm{w}}$ reaction to find the equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{Li}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Li}(\mathrm{OH})($ aq $)$. (Answer: 2.3)

## 6-2 Equilibrium and Thermodynamics

Equilibrium is controlled by the thermodynamics of a chemical reaction. The heat absorbed or released (enthalpy) and the degree of disorder of reactants and products (entropy) independently contribute to the degree to which the reaction is favored or disfavored.

## Enthalpy

The enthalpy change, $\Delta H$, for a reaction is the heat absorbed or released when the reaction takes place under constant applied pressure. ${ }^{5}$ The standard enthalpy change, $\Delta H^{\circ}$, refers to the heat absorbed when all reactants and products are in their standard states: ${ }^{\dagger}$

$$
\mathrm{HCl}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \quad \Delta H^{\circ}=-74.85 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The negative sign of $\Delta H^{\circ}$ indicates that heat is released by Reaction 6-3-the solution becomes warmer. For other reactions, $\Delta H$ is positive, which means that heat is absorbed. Consequently, the solution gets colder during the reaction. A reaction for which $\Delta H$ is positive is said to be endothermic. Whenever $\Delta H$ is negative, the reaction is exothermic.

## Entropy

The entropy, $S$, of a substance is a measure of its "disorder," which we will not attempt to define in a quantitative way. The greater the disorder, the greater the entropy. In general, a gas is more disordered (has higher entropy) than a liquid, which is more disordered than a solid. Ions in aqueous solution are normally more disordered than in their solid salt:

$$
\mathrm{KCl}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{K}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \quad \Delta S^{\circ}=+76.4 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{~mol}) \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

$\Delta S^{\circ}$ is the change in entropy (entropy of products minus entropy of reactants) when all species are in their standard states. The positive value of $\Delta S^{\circ}$ indicates that a mole of $\mathrm{K}^{+}(a q)$ plus a mole of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)$ is more disordered than a mole of $\mathrm{KCl}(s)$. For Reaction 6-3, $\Delta S^{\circ}=-130.4 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{mol})$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The aqueous ions are less disordered than gaseous HCl .

## Free Energy

Systems at constant temperature and pressure, which are common laboratory conditions, have a tendency toward lower enthalpy and higher entropy. A chemical reaction is driven toward the formation of products by a negative value of $\Delta H$ (heat given off) or a positive value of $\Delta S$ (more disorder) or both. When $\Delta H$ is negative and $\Delta S$ is positive, the reaction is clearly favored. When $\Delta H$ is positive and $\Delta S$ is negative, the reaction is clearly disfavored.

[^0]$\Delta H=(+)$
Heat is absorbed Endothermic
$\Delta H=(-)$
Heat is liberated Exothermic
$\Delta S=(+)$
Products more disordered than reactants
$\Delta S=(-)$
Products less disordered than reactants

Note that $25.00^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=298.15 \mathrm{~K}$.

Challenge Satisfy yourself that $\mathrm{K}>1$ if $\Delta G^{\circ}$ is negative.

$\Delta G=(+)$<br>Reaction is disfavored<br>Reaction is favored

Notice that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is omitted from $K$ because it is the solvent.

The reaction quotient has the same form as the equilibrium constant, but the concentrations are generally not the equilibrium concentrations.

When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ are both positive or both negative, what decides whether a reaction will be favored? The change in Gibbs free energy, $\Delta G$, is the arbiter between opposing tendencies of $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$. At constant temperature, $T$,

Free energy:

$$
\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S
$$

A reaction is favored if $\Delta G$ is negative.
For the dissociation of HCl (Reaction 6-3) when all species are in their standard states, $\Delta H^{\circ}$ favors the reaction and $\Delta S^{\circ}$ disfavors it. To find the net result, we evaluate $\Delta G^{\circ}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G^{\circ} & =\Delta H^{\circ}-T \Delta S^{\circ} \\
& =\left(-74.85 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}\right)-(298.15 \mathrm{~K})(-130.4 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{~mol}) \\
& =-35.97 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\Delta G^{\circ}$ is negative, so the reaction is favored when all species are in their standard states. The favorable influence of $\Delta H^{\circ}$ is greater than the unfavorable influence of $\Delta S^{\circ}$ in this case.

The point of discussing free energy is to relate the equilibrium constant to the energetics ( $\Delta H^{\circ}$ and $\Delta S^{\circ}$ ) of a reaction. The equilibrium constant depends on $\Delta G^{\circ}$ in the following manner:

Free energy and equilibrium: $\quad K=\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta G^{\circ} / R T}$
where $R$ is the gas constant $[=8.314472 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{mol})]$ and $T$ is temperature (Kelvin). The more negative the value of $\Delta G^{\circ}$, the larger is the equilibrium constant. For Reaction 6-3,

$$
K=\mathrm{e}^{-\left(-35.97 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}\right) /[8.314472 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{~mol})](298.15 \mathrm{~K})}=2.00 \times 10^{6}
$$

Because the equilibrium constant is large, $\mathrm{HCl}(g)$ is very soluble in water and is nearly completely ionized to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$when it dissolves.

To summarize, a chemical reaction is favored by the liberation of heat ( $\Delta H$ negative) and by an increase in disorder ( $\Delta S$ positive). $\Delta G$ takes both effects into account to determine whether or not a reaction is favorable. We say that a reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions if $\Delta G^{\circ}$ is negative or, equivalently, if $K>1$. The reaction is not spontaneous if $\Delta G^{\circ}$ is positive ( $K<1$ ). You should be able to calculate $K$ from $\Delta G^{\circ}$ and vice versa.

## Le Châtelier's Principle

Suppose that a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change that disturbs the system. Le Châtelier's principle states that the direction in which the system proceeds back to equilibrium is such that the change is partially offset.

To see what this statement means, let's see what happens when we attempt to change the concentration of one species in the reaction

$$
\begin{gathered}
\underset{\text { Bromate }}{\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}}+\underset{\text { Chromium(III) }}{2 \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Br}^{-}+\underset{\text { Dichromate }}{\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+} \\
K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{8}}{\left[\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\right]^{2}}=1 \times 10^{11} \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{gathered}
$$

In one particular equilibrium state of this system, the following concentrations exist: $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=5.0 \mathrm{M},\left[\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}\right]=0.10 \mathrm{M},\left[\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\right]=0.0030 \mathrm{M},\left[\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right]=1.0 \mathrm{M}$, and $\left[\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}\right]=$ 0.043 M . Suppose that the equilibrium is disturbed by adding dichromate to the solution to increase the concentration of $\left[\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}\right]$ from 0.10 to 0.20 M . In what direction will the reaction proceed to reach equilibrium?

According to the principle of Le Châtelier, the reaction should go back to the left to partially offset the increase in dichromate, which appears on the right side of Reaction 6-7. We can verify this algebraically by setting up the reaction quotient, $Q$, which has the same form as the equilibrium constant. The only difference is that $Q$ is evaluated with whatever concentrations happen to exist, even though the solution is not at equilibrium. When the system reaches equilibrium, $Q=K$. For Reaction 6-7,

$$
Q=\frac{(1.0)(0.20)(5.0)^{8}}{(0.043)(0.0030)^{2}}=2 \times 10^{11}>K
$$

Because $Q>K$, the reaction must go to the left to decrease the numerator and increase the denominator, until $Q=K$.

1. If a reaction is at equilibrium and products are added (or reactants are removed), the reaction goes to the left.
2. If a reaction is at equilibrium and reactants are added (or products are removed), the reaction goes to the right.

When the temperature of a system is changed, so is the equilibrium constant. Equations 6-5 and 6-6 can be combined to predict the effect of temperature on $K$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
K=\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta G^{\circ} / \mathrm{RT}}=\mathrm{e}^{-\left(\Delta H^{\circ}-T \Delta S^{\circ}\right) / R T} & =\mathrm{e}^{\left(-\Delta H^{\circ} / R T+\Delta S^{\circ} / R\right)} \\
& =\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\circ} / R T} \cdot \mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\circ} / R}
\end{aligned}
$$

The term $\mathrm{e}^{\Delta S^{\circ} / R}$ is independent of $T$ (at least over a limited temperature range in which $\Delta S^{\circ}$ is constant). The term $\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta H^{\circ} / R T}$ increases with increasing temperature if $\Delta H^{\circ}$ is positive and decreases if $\Delta H^{\circ}$ is negative. Therefore,

1. The equilibrium constant of an endothermic reaction ( $\Delta H^{\circ}=+$ ) increases if the temperature is raised.
2. The equilibrium constant of an exothermic reaction ( $\Delta H^{\circ}=-$ ) decreases if the temperature is raised.

These statements can be understood in terms of Le Châtelier's principle as follows. Consider an endothermic reaction:
Heat + reactants ⇌ products

If the temperature is raised, then heat is added to the system. The reaction proceeds to the right to partially offset this change. ${ }^{6}$

In dealing with equilibrium problems, we are making thermodynamic predictions, not kinetic predictions. We are calculating what must happen for a system to reach equilibrium, but not how long it will take. Some reactions are over in an instant; others will not reach equilibrium in a million years. For example, dynamite remains unchanged indefinitely, until a spark sets off the spontaneous, explosive decomposition. The size of an equilibrium constant tells us nothing about the rate (the kinetics) of the reaction. A large equilibrium constant does not imply that a reaction is fast.

## 6-3 Solubility Product

In chemical analysis, we encounter solubility in precipitation titrations, electrochemical reference cells, and gravimetric analysis. The effect of acid on the solubility of minerals and the effect of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ on the solubility (and death) of coral reefs are important in environmental science.

The solubility product is the equilibrium constant for the reaction in which a solid salt dissolves to give its constituent ions in solution. Solid is omitted from the equilibrium constant because it is in its standard state. Appendix F lists solubility products.

As an example, consider the dissolution of mercury(I) chloride ( $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, also called mercurous chloride) in water. The reaction is

$$
\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}
$$

for which the solubility product, $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$, is

$$
K_{\mathrm{sp}}=\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}=1.2 \times 10^{-18}
$$

A solution containing excess, undissolved solid is said to be saturated with that solid. The solution contains all the solid capable of being dissolved under the prevailing conditions.

The physical meaning of the solubility product is this: If an aqueous solution is left in contact with excess solid $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, the solid will dissolve until the condition $\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}=K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ is satisfied. Thereafter, the amount of undissolved solid remains constant. Unless excess solid remains, there is no guarantee that $\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}=K_{\mathrm{sp}}$. If $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are mixed together (with appropriate counterions) such that the product $\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}$ exceeds $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$, then $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ will precipitate.

If $Q<K$, then the reaction must proceed to the right to reach equilibrium. If $Q>K$, then the reaction must proceed to the left to reach equilibrium.

$$
\mathrm{e}^{(a+b)}=\mathrm{e}^{a} \cdot \mathrm{e}^{b}
$$

Heat can be treated as if it were a reactant in an endothermic reaction and a product in an exothermic reaction.

Mercurous ion, $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$, is a dimer (pronounced DIE mer), which means that it consists of two identical units bound together:

$$
\left[\mathrm{Hg}-\mathrm{Hg}^{2+}\right.
$$

+1 oxidation state of mercury
$\mathrm{OH}^{-}, \mathrm{S}^{2-}$, and $\mathrm{CN}^{-}$stabilize $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{II})$, thereby converting $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{I})$ into $\mathrm{Hg}(0)$ and $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{II})$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\operatorname{Hg} 2+}{2+}+\underset{\operatorname{Hg}(\mathrm{II})}{\operatorname{Hg}(\mathrm{I})}+\underset{\operatorname{Hg}(0)}{\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}(a q)}+\underset{(l)}{\mathrm{Hg}(l)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Disproportionation is the process in which an element in an intermediate oxidation state gives products in both higher and lower oxidation states.

If we want to know how much $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ is dissolved in a saturated solution of $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, we are tempted to look at Reaction 6-9 and to note that two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are created for each $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$. If we let $x$ be the concentration of $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$, we could say that the concentration of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is $2 x$. Substituting these values into the solubility product expression 6-10, we could write $K_{\mathrm{sp}}=\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}=(x)(2 x)^{2}$, and we would find $\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]=x=6.7 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$.

However, this answer is incorrect because we have not accounted for other reactions, such as

Hydrolysis:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{OH}^{+}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \quad K=10^{-5.3} \\
2 \mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+} & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}^{2+}+\mathrm{Hg}(l) \quad K=10^{-2.1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Both reactions consume $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$. By Le Chatelier's principle, if $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ is consumed, more $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ will dissolve. We need to know all significant chemical reactions to compute the solubility of a compound.

A salt is any ionic solid, such as $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$.

Common ion effect: A salt is less soluble if one of its ions is already present in the solution. Demonstration 6-1 illustrates the common ion effect.

We most commonly use the solubility product to find the concentration of one ion when the concentration of the other is known or fixed by some means. For example, what is the concentration of $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ in equilibrium with $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in a solution of KCl containing excess, undissolved $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(s)$ ? To answer this question, we rearrange Equation 6-10 to find

$$
\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]=\frac{K_{\mathrm{sp}}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}}=\frac{1.2 \times 10^{-18}}{0.10^{2}}=1.2 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{M}
$$

Because $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ is so slightly soluble, additional $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$obtained from $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ is negligible compared with $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

The solubility product does not tell the entire story of solubility. In addition to complications described in Box 6-1, most salts form soluble ion pairs to some extent. That is, MX( $s$ ) can give $\mathrm{MX}(a q)$ as well as $\mathrm{M}^{+}(a q)$ and $\mathrm{X}^{-}(a q)$. In a saturated solution of $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$, for example, two-thirds of the dissolved calcium is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and one third is $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}(a q) .^{7} \mathrm{The} \mathrm{CaSO}_{4}(a q)$ ion pair is a closely associated pair of ions that behaves as one species in solution. Appendix J and Box 7-1 provide information on ion pairs. ${ }^{8}$

## Common Ion Effect

For the ionic solubility reaction

$$
\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-} \quad K_{\mathrm{sp}}=2.4 \times 10^{-5}
$$

the product $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\right]$ is constant at equilibrium in the presence of excess solid $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$. If the concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ were increased by adding another source of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, such as $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$, then the concentration of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ must decrease so that the product [ $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ] [ $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ ] remains constant. In other words, less $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}(s)$ will dissolve if $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ is already present from some other source. Figure 6-1 shows how the solubility of $\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}$ decreases in the presence of dissolved $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$.

This application of Le Chatelier's principle is called the common ion effect. A salt will be less soluble if one of its constituent ions is already present in the solution.

## DEMONSTRATION 6-1 Common Ion Effect ${ }^{9,10}$

Fill two large test tubes about one-third full with saturated aqueous KCl containing no excess solid. The solubility of KCl is approximately 3.7 M , so the solubility product (ignoring activity effects introduced later) is

$$
K_{\mathrm{sp}} \approx\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]=(3.7)(3.7)=13.7
$$

Now add one-third of a test tube of 6 M HCl to one test tube and an equal volume of 12 M HCl to the other. Even though a common ion, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, is added in each case, KCl precipitates only in one tube.

To understand your observations, calculate the concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in each tube after HCl addition. Then evaluate the reaction quotient, $Q=\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, for each tube. Explain your observations.

## Separation by Precipitation

Precipitation can sometimes be used to separate ions from each other. ${ }^{11}$ For example, consider a solution containing lead(II) ( $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ) and mercury(I) ( $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ ) ions, each at a concentration of 0.010 M . Each forms an insoluble iodide (Figure 6-2), but the mercury(I) iodide is considerably less soluble, as indicated by the smaller value of $K_{\text {sp }}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=7.9 \times 10^{-9} \\
\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}(s) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=4.6 \times 10^{-29}
\end{aligned}
$$

Is it possible to lower the concentration of $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ by $99.990 \%$ by selective precipitation with $\mathrm{I}^{-}$, without precipitating $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ?

We are asking whether we can lower $\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}\right]$ to $0.010 \%$ of $0.010 \mathrm{M}=1.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ without precipitating $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. Here is the experiment: We add enough $\mathrm{I}^{-}$to precipitate $99.990 \%$ of $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ if all the $\mathrm{I}^{-}$reacts with $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ and none reacts with $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. To see if any $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ should precipitate, we need to know the concentration of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$in equilibrium with precipitated $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}(s)$ plus the remaining $1.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}(s) & \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{sp}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} \\
{\left[\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2} } & =K_{\mathrm{sp}} \\
\left(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\right)\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2} & =4.6 \times 10^{-29} \\
{\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right] } & =\sqrt{\frac{4.6 \times 10^{-29}}{1.0 \times 10^{-6}}}=6.8 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{M}
\end{aligned}
$$

Will this concentration of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$cause $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ to precipitate? That is, is the solubility product of $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ exceeded?

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q=\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2} & =(0.010)\left(6.8 \times 10^{-12}\right)^{2} \\
& =4.6 \times 10^{-25}<K_{\mathrm{sp}} \quad\left(\text { for } \mathrm{PbI}_{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The reaction quotient, $Q=4.6 \times 10^{-25}$ is less than $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ for $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}=7.9 \times 10^{-9}$. Therefore, $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ will not precipitate and separation of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ is feasible. We predict that adding $\mathrm{I}^{-}$to a solution of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Hg}_{2}^{2+}$ will precipitate virtually all the mercury(I) before any lead(II) precipitates.

Life should be so easy! We have just made a thermodynamic prediction. If the system comes to equilibrium, we can achieve the desired separation. However, occasionally one sub-

The smaller $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ implies a lower solubility for $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}$ because the stoichiometries of the two reactions are the same. If the stoichiometries were different, it does not follow that the smaller $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ would imply lower solubility. stance coprecipitates with the other. In coprecipitation, a substance whose solubility is not

Question If you want to know whether a small amount of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ coprecipitates with $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}$, should you measure the $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ concentration in the mother liquor (the solution) or the $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ concentration in the precipitate? Which measurement is more sensitive? By "sensitive," we mean responsive to a small amount of coprecipitation. (Answer: Measure $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ in precipitate.)

Notation for these equilibrium constants is discussed in Box 6-2.
exceeded precipitates along with another substance whose solubility is exceeded. For example, some $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ might become adsorbed on the surface of the $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{I}_{2}$ crystal or might even occupy sites within the crystal. Our calculation says that the separation is worth trying. Only an experiment can show whether the separation actually works.

## 6-4 Complex Formation

If anion $\mathrm{X}^{-}$precipitates metal $\mathrm{M}^{+}$, it is often observed that a high concentration of $\mathrm{X}^{-}$causes solid MX to redissolve. The increased solubility arises from formation of complex ions, such as $\mathrm{MX}_{2}^{-}$, which consist of two or more simple ions bonded to one another.

## Lewis Acids and Bases

In complex ions such as $\mathrm{PbI}^{+}, \mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}$, iodide is said to be the ligand of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. A ligand is any atom or group of atoms attached to the species of interest. We say that $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ acts as a Lewis acid and $\mathrm{I}^{-}$acts as a Lewis base in these complexes. A Lewis acid accepts a pair of electrons from a Lewis base when the two form a bond:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-08.jpg?height=183&width=545&top_left_y=802&top_left_x=1096)

The product of the reaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is called an adduct. The bond between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is called a dative or coordinate covalent bond.

## Effect of Complex Ion Formation on Solubility ${ }^{\mathbf{1 2}}$

If $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{I}^{-}$only reacted to form solid $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$, then the solubility of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ would always be very low in the presence of excess $\mathrm{I}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s) \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{sp}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} \quad K_{\mathrm{sp}}=\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2}=7.9 \times 10^{-9}
$$

We observe, however, that high concentrations of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$cause solid $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$ to dissolve. We explain this by the formation of a series of complex ions:
$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+\mathrm{I}^{-} \stackrel{K_{1}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{PbI}^{+}$
$K_{1}=\left[\mathrm{PbI}^{+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{2}$
$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{I}^{-} \stackrel{\beta_{2}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)$
$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+3 \mathrm{I}^{-} \stackrel{\beta_{3}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}$
$\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{I}^{-} \stackrel{\beta_{4}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}$
$\beta_{4}=\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}\right] /\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{4}=3.0 \times 10^{4}$

The species $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})$ in Reaction 6-13 is dissolved $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$, containing two iodine atoms bound to a lead atom. Reaction 6-13 is not the reverse of Reaction 6-11, in which the species is solid $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}$.

## BOX 6-2 Notation For Formation Constants

Formation constants are the equilibrium constants for complex ion formation. The stepwise formation constants, designated $K_{i}$, are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{M}+\mathrm{X} \stackrel{K_{1}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MX} & K_{1}=[\mathrm{MX}] /[\mathrm{M}][\mathrm{X}] \\
\mathrm{MX}+\mathrm{X} \stackrel{K_{2}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MX}_{2} & K_{2}=\left[\mathrm{MX}_{2}\right] /[\mathrm{MX}][\mathrm{X}] \\
\mathrm{MX}_{n-1}+\mathrm{X} \stackrel{K_{n}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MX}_{n} & K_{n}=\left[\mathrm{MX}_{n}\right] /\left[\mathrm{MX}_{n-1}\right][\mathrm{X}]
\end{aligned}
$$

The overall, or cumulative, formation constants are denoted $\beta_{i}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{M}+2 \mathrm{X} \stackrel{\beta_{2}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MX}_{2} & \beta_{2}=\left[\mathrm{MX}_{2}\right] /[\mathrm{M}][\mathrm{X}]^{2} \\
\mathrm{M}+n \mathrm{X} \stackrel{\beta_{n}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MX}_{n} & \beta_{n}=\left[\mathrm{MX}_{n}\right] /[\mathrm{M}][\mathrm{X}]^{n}
\end{array}
$$

A useful relation is that $\beta_{n}=K_{1} K_{2} \cdots K_{n}$. Some formation constants can be found in Appendix I.

At low $\mathrm{I}^{-}$concentrations, the solubility of lead is governed by precipitation of $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s)$. At high $\mathrm{I}^{-}$concentrations, Reactions 6-12 through 6-15 are driven to the right (Le Châtelier's principle), and the total concentration of dissolved lead is considerably greater than that of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ alone (Figure 6-3).

A most useful characteristic of chemical equilibrium is that all equilibria are satisfied simultaneously. If we know [ $\mathrm{I}^{-}$], we can calculate $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]$ by substituting the value of $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]$into

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-09.jpg?height=988&width=776&top_left_y=96&top_left_x=493)
FIGURE 6-3 Total solubility of lead(II) (curve with circles) and solubilities of individual species (straight lines) as a function of the concentration of free iodide. To the left of the minimum, $[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}$ is governed by the solubility product for $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s)$. As $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]$increases, $[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}$ decreases because of the common ion effect. At high values of $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right], \mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s)$ redissolves because it reacts with $\mathrm{I}^{-}$to form soluble complex ions, such as $\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}$. Note logarithmic scales. The solution is made slightly acidic so that $\left[\mathrm{PbOH}^{+}\right]$is negligible.

the equilibrium constant expression for Reaction 6-11, regardless of whether there are other reactions involving $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. The concentration of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ that satisfies any one equilibrium must satisfy all equilibria. There can be only one concentration of $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ in the solution.

## EXAMPLE Effect of $\mathbf{I}^{-}$on the Solubility of $\mathbf{P b}^{\mathbf{2 +}}$

Find the concentrations of $\mathrm{PbI}^{+}, \mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q), \mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}$ in a solution saturated with $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s)$ and containing dissolved $\mathrm{I}^{-}$with a concentration of (a) 0.0010 M and (b) 1.0 M .

Solution (a) From $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ for Reaction 6-11, we calculate

$$
\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]=K_{\mathrm{sp}} /\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2}=\left(7.9 \times 10^{-9}\right) /(0.0010)^{2}=7.9 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}
$$

From Reaction 6-12 through 6-15, we then calculate the concentrations of the other leadcontaining species:

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}^{+}\right]=} & K_{1}\left[\mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]\right. \\
& =\left(1.0 \times 10^{2}\right)\left(7.9 \times 10^{-3}\right)\left(1.0 \times 10^{-3}\right) \\
& =7.9 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)\right] } & =\beta_{2}\left[\mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{2} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}\right] } & =\beta_{3}\left[\mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{3} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}\right] } & =6.6 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M} \\
& =\beta_{4}\left[\mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]^{4} \\
& =2.4 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) If, instead, we take $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]=1.0 \mathrm{M}$, then analogous computations show that

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
{\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]=7.9 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{M}} & {\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}\right]=6.6 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}^{+}\right]=7.9 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}} & {\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}\right]=2.4 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)\right]=1.1 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M}}
\end{array}
$$

Test Yourself Find $\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right],\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}\right]$, in a saturated solution of $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s)$ with $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]=0.10 \mathrm{M}$. (Answer: $7.9 \times 10^{-7}, 1.1 \times 10^{-5}, 6.6 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$ )

The effect of dissolved ions on chemical equilibria is the subject of Chapter 7.

Brønsted-Lowry acid: proton donor Brønsted-Lowry base: proton acceptor J. N. Brønsted (1879-1947) of the University of Copenhagen and T. M. Lowry (1874-1936) of Cambridge University independently published their definitions of acids and bases in 1923.

The total concentration of dissolved lead in the preceding example is

$$
[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}=\left[\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{PbI}^{+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)\right]+\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{3}^{-}\right]+\left[\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}\right]
$$

When $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]=10^{-3} \mathrm{M},[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}=8.7 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$, of which $91 \%$ is $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. As $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]$increases, $[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}$ decreases by the common ion effect operating in Reaction 6-11. However, at sufficiently high $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]$, complex formation takes over and $[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}$ increases in Figure 6-3. When $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]= 1.0 \mathrm{M},[\mathrm{Pb}]_{\text {total }}=3.2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$, of which $76 \%$ is $\mathrm{PbI}_{4}^{2-}$.

## Tabulated Equilibrium Constants Are Usually Not "Constant"

If you look up the equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction in two different books, there is an excellent chance that the values will be different (sometimes by a factor of 10 or more). ${ }^{13}$ This discrepancy occurs because the constant may have been determined under different conditions and, perhaps, by using different techniques.

A common source of variation in the reported value of $K$ is the ionic composition of the solution. Note whether $K$ is reported for a particular ionic composition (for example, 1 M $\mathrm{NaClO}_{4}$ ) or whether $K$ has been extrapolated to zero ion concentration. If you need an equilibrium constant for your own work, choose a value of $K$ measured under conditions as close as possible to those you will employ.

## 6-5 Protic Acids and Bases

Understanding the behavior of acids and bases is essential to every branch of science having anything to do with chemistry. In analytical chemistry, we almost always need to account for the effect of pH on analytical reactions involving complex formation or oxidation-reduction. pH can affect molecular charge and shape-factors that help determine which molecules can be separated from others in chromatography and electrophoresis and which molecules will be detected in some types of mass spectrometry.

In aqueous chemistry, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$ (hydronium ion) when added to water. Conversely, a base decreases the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$. We will see that a decrease in $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$concentration necessarily requires an increase in $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$concentration. Therefore, a base increases the concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$in aqueous solution.

The word protic refers to chemistry involving transfer of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from one molecule to another. The species $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is also called a proton because it is what remains when a hydrogen atom loses its electron. Hydronium ion, $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$, is a combination of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Although $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$ is a more accurate representation than $\mathrm{H}^{+}$for the hydrogen ion in aqueous solution, we will use $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$interchangeably in this book.

## Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases

Brønsted and Lowry classified acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors. HCl is an acid (a proton donor), and it increases the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$in water:

$$
\mathrm{HCl}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}
$$

The Brønsted-Lowry definition does not require that $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$be formed. This definition can therefore be extended to nonaqueous solvents and to the gas phase:

$$
\underset{\substack{\mathrm{HCl}(g) \\ \text { Hydrochloric acid } \\ \text { (acid) }}}{\underset{\text { Ammonia }}{\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)}} \underset{\substack{\text { (base) } \\ \text { Ammonium chloride }}}{\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(s)}
$$

For the remainder of this book, when we speak of acids and bases, we are speaking of Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases.

## Salts

Any ionic solid, such as ammonium chloride, is called a salt. In a formal sense, a salt can be thought of as the product of an acid-base reaction. When an acid and a base react, they are said to neutralize each other. Most salts containing cations and anions with single positive and negative charges are strong electrolytes-they dissociate nearly completely into ions in dilute aqueous solution. Thus, ammonium chloride gives $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in water:

$$
\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(s) \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)
$$

## Conjugate Acids and Bases

The products of a reaction between an acid and a base are also classified as acids and bases:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-11.jpg?height=492&width=1210&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=275)

Acetate is a base because it can accept a proton to make acetic acid. Methylammonium ion is an acid because it can donate a proton and become methylamine. Acetic acid and the acetate ion are said to be a conjugate acid-base pair. Methylamine and methylammonium ion are likewise conjugate. Conjugate acids and bases are related to each other by the gain or loss of one $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

## The Nature of $\mathbf{H}^{+}$and $\mathbf{O H}^{-}$

The proton does not exist by itself in water. The simplest formula found in some crystalline salts is $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$. For example, crystals of perchloric acid monohydrate contain pyramidal hydronium (also called hydroxonium) ions:

$$
\mathrm{HClO}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { is really }\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 
& & \\
& \ddot{\mathrm{O}} & \\
\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{H}} & \mathrm{H} & \mathrm{H}
\end{array}\right]^{+}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mathrm{O} & \\
\mid & \mathrm{Cl} \\
& \mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{H}} \\
\mathrm{O} & \mathrm{O}
\end{array}\right]_{\text {Perchlorate }}
$$

The formula $\mathrm{HClO}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is a way of specifying the composition of the substance when we are ignorant of its structure. A more accurate formula would be $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+} \mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$.

Average dimensions of the $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$cation in many crystals are shown in Figure 6-4. In aqueous solution, $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$is tightly associated with three molecules of water through exceptionally strong hydrogen bonds (Figure 6-5). The $\mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{+}$cation is another simple species in which a hydrogen ion is shared by two water molecules. ${ }^{16,17}$

The $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H} \cdots \mathrm{O}$ hydrogen-bonded distance of 252 pm (picometers, $10^{-12} \mathrm{~m}$ ) compares with an $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H} \cdots \mathrm{O}$ distance of 283 pm between hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The discrete cation $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{3} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$found in some crystals is similar in structure to $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{4} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$, with the weakly bonded $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at the top removed. ${ }^{15}$

We will write $\mathrm{H}^{+}$when we really mean $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$.

$$

Recall that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (the solvent) is omitted from the equilibrium constant. The value $K_{\mathrm{w}}=1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is accurate enough for problems in this book.

We will ordinarily write $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in most chemical equations, although we really mean $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$. To emphasize the chemistry of water, we will write $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$. For example, water can be either an acid or a base. Water is an acid with respect to methoxide:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-12.jpg?height=104&width=935&top_left_y=1184&top_left_x=903)

Autoprotolysis
of water:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{w}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \quad K_{\mathrm{w}}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]
$$

Table 6-1 shows how $K_{\mathrm{w}}$ varies with temperature. Its value at $25.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $1.01 \times 10^{-14}$.

But with respect to hydrogen bromide, water is a base:

$$
\underset{\text { Water }}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}+\underset{\substack{\text { Hydrogen } \\ \text { bromide }}}{\mathrm{HBr}} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\substack{\text { Hydronium } \\ \text { ion }}}{\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}}+\underset{\text { Bromide }}{\mathrm{Br}^{-}}
$$

## Autoprotolysis

Water undergoes self-ionization, called autoprotolysis, in which it acts as both an acid and a base:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

or

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

Reactions 6-16 and 6-17 mean the same thing.
Protic solvents have a reactive $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, and all protic solvents undergo autoprotolysis. An example is acetic acid:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-12.jpg?height=161&width=883&top_left_y=1944&top_left_x=926)

The extent of these reactions is very small. The autoprotolysis constants (equilibrium constants) for Reactions 6-17 and 6-18 are $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ and $3.5 \times 10^{-15}$, respectively, at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## 6-6 pH

a. Concentrations in the product $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$in this table are expressed in molality rather than in molarity. Accuracy of log $K_{w}$ is $\pm 0.01$. To convert molality (mol/kg) into molarity (mol/L), multiply by the density of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at each temperature. At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, K_{w}=10^{-13.995}(\mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{kg})^{2}(0.99705 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{L})^{2}=10^{-13.998}(\mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})^{2}$.

## EXAMPLE Concentration of $\mathbf{H}^{+}$and $\mathbf{O H}^{-}$in Pure Water at $\mathbf{2 5}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} \mathbf{C}$

Calculate the concentrations of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$in pure water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Solution The stoichiometry of Reaction 6-19 tells us that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$are produced in a 1:1 molar ratio. Their concentrations must be equal. Calling each concentration $x$, we can write

$$
K_{\mathrm{w}}=1.0 \times 10^{-14}=\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=[x][x] \Rightarrow x=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}
$$

The concentrations of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$are both $1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ in pure water.
Test Yourself Use Table 6-1 to find the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$in water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. (Answer: $7.4 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.4 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{M}$ )

## EXAMPLE Concentration of $\mathbf{O H}^{-}$When $\boldsymbol{[} \mathbf{H}^{+} \boldsymbol{]}$ Is Known

What is the concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$if $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ ? (From now on, assume that the temperature is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ unless otherwise stated.)

Solution Putting $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ into the $K_{\mathrm{w}}$ expression gives

$$
K_{\mathrm{w}}=1.0 \times 10^{-14}=\left(1.0 \times 10^{-3}\right)\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] \Rightarrow\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}
$$

A concentration of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ gives $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$. As the concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$increases, the concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$necessarily decreases, and vice versa. A concentration of $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$ gives $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$.

Test Yourself Find $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$if $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$. (Answer: $1.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ )

An approximate definition of $\mathbf{p H}$ is the negative logarithm of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration.
Approximate definition of pH :

$$
\mathrm{pH} \approx-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]
$$

Chapter 7 defines pH more accurately in terms of activities, but, for many purposes, Equation 6-20 is a good definition. The measurement of pH with glass electrodes, and buffers used by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology to define the pH scale, are described in Chapter 14.

In pure water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$, the pH is $-\log \left(1.0 \times 10^{-7}\right)=7.00$. If $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{M}$, then $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.0 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$ and the pH is 11.00 . A useful relation between [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] and [ $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$] is

$$
\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH}=-\log \left(K_{\mathrm{w}}\right)=14.00 \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

where $\mathrm{pOH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$, just as $\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. Equation 6-21 is a fancy way of saying that if $\mathrm{pH}=3.58$, then $\mathrm{pOH}=14.00-3.58=10.42$, or $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]=10^{-10.42}=3.8 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{M}$.
$\mathrm{pH} \approx-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. The term " pH " was introduced in 1909 by the Danish biochemist S. P. L. Sørensen, who called it the "hydrogen ion exponent." ${ }^{20}$

Take the log of both sides of the $K_{\mathrm{w}}$ expression to derive Equation 6-21:

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{\mathrm{w}} & =\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] \\
\log K_{\mathrm{w}} & =\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] \\
-\log K_{\mathrm{w}} & =-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]-\log \left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] \\
14.00 & =\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH} \quad\left(\text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

pH is measured with a glass electrode described in Chapter 14.
The surface of water or ice is $\sim 2 \mathrm{pH}$ units more acidic than the bulk because $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$is more stable on the surface. Surface acidity could be important to the chemistry of atmospheric clouds. ${ }^{21}$

[^1]FIGURE 6-7 pH of various substances. [From Chem. Eng. News, 14 September 1981.] The most acidic rainfall (Box 14-1) is a stronger acid than lemon juice. The most acidic natural waters known are mine waters, with total dissolved metal concentrations of $200 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ and sulfate concentrations of $760 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L} .^{22}$ The pH of this water, -3.6, does not mean that $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10^{3.6} \mathrm{M}= 4000 \mathrm{M}!$ It means that the activity of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (discussed in Chapter 7) is $10^{3.6}$.

A solution is acidic if $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]>\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$. A solution is basic if $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]<\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$. At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, an acidic solution has a pH below 7 and a basic solution has a pH above 7 .

pH values for various common substances are shown in Figure 6-7.
Although pH generally falls in the range 0 to 14 , these are not the limits of pH . A pH of -1 , for example, means $-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=-1$; or $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=10 \mathrm{M}$. This concentration is attained in a concentrated solution of a strong acid such as HCl .

## Is There Such a Thing as Pure Water?

In most labs, the answer is "No." Pure water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ should have a pH of 7.00 . Distilled water from the tap in most labs is acidic because it contains $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the atmosphere. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is an acid by virtue of the reaction

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { Bicarbonate }}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can be largely removed by boiling water and then protecting it from the atmosphere.
More than a century ago, careful measurements of the conductivity of water were made by F. Kohlrausch and his students. To remove impurities, they found it necessary to distill water 42 consecutive times under vacuum to reduce conductivity to a limiting value.

## 6-7 Strengths of Acids and Bases

Acids and bases are commonly classified as strong or weak, depending on whether they react nearly "completely" or only "partially" to produce $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. Although there is no sharp distinction between weak and strong, some acids or bases react so completely that they are easily classified as strong-and, by convention, everything else is termed weak.

## Strong Acids and Bases

Common strong acids and bases are listed in Table 6-2, which you need to memorize. By definition, a strong acid or base is completely dissociated in aqueous solution. That is, the equilibrium constants for the following reactions are large.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{HCl}(a q) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \\
\mathrm{KOH}(a q) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{K}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
\end{aligned}
$$

Virtually no undissociated HCl or KOH exists in aqueous solution. Demonstration 6-2 shows a consequence of the strong-acid behavior of HCl .

## DEMONSTRATION 6-2 The HCl Fountain

The complete dissociation of HCl into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$makes $\mathrm{HCl}(g)$ extremely soluble in water.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{HCl}(g) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCl}(a q) \\
\mathrm{HCl}(a q) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q) \\
\cline { 2 - 2 } \text { Net reaction: } \quad \mathrm{HCl}(g) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the equilibrium of Reaction B lies far to the right, it pulls Reaction A to the right as well.

Challenge The standard free energy change ( $\Delta G^{\circ}$ ) for Reaction C is $-36.0 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. Show that the equilibrium constant is $2.0 \times 10^{6}$.

The extreme solubility of $\mathrm{HCl}(g)$ in water is the basis for the HCl fountain, ${ }^{23}$ assembled as shown below. In Figure $a$, an inverted $250-\mathrm{mL}$ round-bottom flask containing air is set up with its inlet
tube leading to a source of $\mathrm{HCl}(g)$ and its outlet tube directed into an inverted bottle of water. As HCl is admitted to the flask, air is displaced. When the bottle is filled with air, the flask is filled mostly with $\mathrm{HCl}(g)$.

The hoses are disconnected and replaced with a beaker of indicator and a rubber bulb (Figure $b$ ). For an indicator, we use slightly alkaline, commercial methyl purple solution, which is green above pH 5.4 and purple below pH 4.8 . When $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water is squirted from the rubber bulb into the flask, a vacuum is created and indicator solution is drawn up into the flask, making a fascinating fountain (Color Plate 1).

Question Why is a vacuum created when water is squirted into the flask, and why does the indicator change color when it enters the flask?

Dissociation of weak acid:

Even though the hydrogen halides $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{HBr}$, and HI are strong acids, HF is not a strong acid, as explained in Box 6-3. For most purposes, the hydroxides of the alkaline earth metals $\left(\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Sr}^{2+}\right.$, and $\left.\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}\right)$ can be considered to be strong bases, although they are far less soluble than alkali metal hydroxides and have some tendency to form $\mathrm{MOH}^{+}$complexes (Table 6-3). The strongest known base is the gas-phase molecule $\mathrm{LiO}^{-} .^{25}$

## Weak Acids and Bases

All weak acids, denoted HA, react with water by donating a proton to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :
Dissociation of weak acid: $\quad \mathrm{HA}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{a}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-}$
which means exactly the same as

$$
\mathrm{HA} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{a}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-} \quad K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]}
$$

The equilibrium constant is called $K_{\mathrm{a}}$, the acid dissociation constant. By definition, a weak acid is one that is only partially dissociated in water, so $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is "small."

## BOX 6-3 The Strange Behavior of Hydrofluoric Acid ${ }^{14}$

The hydrogen halides $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{HBr}$, and HI are all strong acids, which means that the reactions

$$
\mathrm{HX}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{X}^{-}
$$

( $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Br}, \mathrm{I}$ ) all go to completion. Why, then, does HF behave as a weak acid?

The answer is odd. First, HF does completely give up its proton to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\mathrm{HF}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \underset{\substack{\text { Hydronium } \\ \text { ion }}}{\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}}+\underset{\substack{\text { Fluoride } \\ \text { ion }}}{\mathrm{F}^{-}}
$$

But fluoride forms the strongest hydrogen bond of any ion. The hydronium ion remains tightly associated with $\mathrm{F}^{-}$through a hydrogen bond. We call such an association an ion pair.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{F}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { An ion pair }}{\mathrm{F}^{-} \cdots \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}}
$$

Ion pairs are common in aqueous solutions of any ion with a charge greater than 1 . Ion pairs are the rule in nonaqueous solvents, which cannot promote ion dissociation as well as water.

Thus, HF does not behave as a strong acid because $\mathrm{F}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$remain associated with each other. Dissolving one mole of the strong acid HCl in water creates one mole of free $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$. Dissolving one mole of the "weak" acid HF in water creates little free $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$.

HF is not unique in its propensity to form ion pairs. Many moderately strong acids, such as those below, are thought to exist predominantly as ion pairs in aqueous solution ( $\mathrm{HA}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \left.\mathrm{A}^{-} \cdots \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}\right) .{ }^{24}$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{CF}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H} \\
\text { Trifluoroacetic acid } \\
K_{\mathrm{a}}=0.31
\end{gathered}

A carboxylate anion (weak base, $\mathrm{A}^{-}$)

Weak bases, B , react with water by abstracting a proton from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Base } \\
& \text { hydrolysis: }
\end{aligned} \quad \mathrm{B}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{b}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{BH}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \quad K_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{BH}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\mathrm{B}}
$$

The equilibrium constant $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ is the base hydrolysis constant, which is "small" for a weak base.

## Common Classes of Weak Acids and Bases

Acetic acid is a typical weak acid.

Acetic acid is a representative carboxylic acid, which has the general formula $\mathrm{RCO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$, where R is an organic substituent. Most carboxylic acids are weak acids, and most carboxylate anions are weak bases.

Methylamine is a typical weak base.

Amines are weak bases, and ammonium ions are weak acids. The "parent" of all amines is ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. When a base such as methylamine reacts with water, the product is the conjugate acid. That is, methylammonium ion produced in Reaction 6-27 is a weak acid:

$$
\underset{\mathrm{BH}^{+}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3}} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{a}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \underset{\mathrm{~B}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3}} \underset{\mathrm{~N}}{\stackrel{\mathrm{~N}}{ } \mathrm{H}_{2}}+\mathbf{H}^{+} \quad K_{\mathrm{a}}=2.26 \times 10^{-11}
$$

The methylammonium ion is the conjugate acid of methylamine.
You should learn to recognize whether a compound is acidic or basic. The salt methylammonium chloride, for example, dissociates in aqueous solution to give methylammonium cation and chloride:

$$
\underset{\substack{\text { Methylammonium } \\ \text { chloride }}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}(s)} \rightarrow \underset{\substack{\text { Methylammonium } \\ \text { ion }}}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3}(a q)}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(a q)
$$

Methylammonium ion, being the conjugate acid of methylamine, is a weak acid (Reaction 6-28). Chloride is the conjugate base of HCl , a strong acid. In other words, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$has virtually no tendency to associate with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, or else HCl would not be a strong acid. Methylammonium chloride is acidic because methylammonium ion is an acid and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is not a base.

Metal cations, $\mathrm{M}^{n+}$ act as weak acids by acid hydrolysis to form $\mathrm{M}(\mathrm{OH})^{(n-1)+.{ }^{26}}$ Figure 6-8 shows acid dissociation constants for the reaction

$$
\mathrm{M}^{n+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{a}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{MOH}^{(n-1)+}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Monovalent metal ions are very weak acids $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}, K_{\mathrm{a}}=10^{-13.9}\right)$. Divalent ions tend to be stronger ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, K_{\mathrm{a}}=10^{-9.4}$ ) and trivalent ions are stronger yet ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, K_{\mathrm{a}}=10^{-2.19}$ ).

## Polyprotic Acids and Bases

Polyprotic acids and bases are compounds that can donate or accept more than one proton. For example, oxalic acid is diprotic and phosphate is tribasic:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/28f11ca4-df3d-4af7-8945-a9c4ba184489-17.jpg?height=183&width=893&top_left_y=2356&top_left_x=424)

Although we will usually write a base as B and an acid as HA , it is important to realize that $\mathrm{BH}^{+}$is also an acid and $\mathrm{A}^{-}$is also a base.

Methylammonium chloride is a weak acid because

1. It dissociates into $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.
2. $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$is a weak acid, being conjugate to $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{2}$, a weak base.
3. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$has no basic properties. It is conjugate to HCl , a strong acid. That is, HCl dissociates completely.

Challenge Phenol ( $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ ) is a weak acid. Explain why a solution of the ionic compound potassium phenolate $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}^{-} \mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$is basic.

Aqueous metal ions are associated with (hydrated by) several $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules, so a more accurate way to write the acid dissociation reaction is

$$
\mathrm{M}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{x}^{n+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{M}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{x-1}(\mathrm{OH})^{(n-1)}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Notation for acid and base equilibrium constants: $K_{\mathrm{a} 1}$ refers to the acidic species with the most protons and $K_{\mathrm{b} 1}$ refers to the basic species with the least protons. The subscript "a" in acid dissociation constants will usually be omitted.

Standard notation for successive acid dissociation constants of a polyprotic acid is $K_{1}, K_{2}, K_{3}$, and so on, with the subscript "a" usually omitted. We retain or omit the subscript as dictated by clarity. For successive base hydrolysis constants, we retain the subscript "b." The preceding examples illustrate that $K_{\mathrm{a} 1}$ (or $K_{1}$ ) refers to the acidic species with the most protons, and $K_{\mathrm{b} 1}$ refers to the basic species with the least number of protons. Carbonic acid, a very important diprotic carboxylic acid derived from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, is described in Box 6-4.

## BOX 6-4 Carbonic Acid ${ }^{27}$

Carbonic acid is formed by the reaction of carbon dioxide with water:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q) K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)\right]}{P_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}=0.0344 \\
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \overbrace{\substack{\mathrm{HO} \\
\text { Carbonic acid }}}^{\mathrm{O}} \quad K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)\right]} \approx 0.002 \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \underset{\text { Bicarbonate }}{\underset{\text { Carbonate }}{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}+\mathrm{H}^{+}} \quad K_{\mathrm{a} 1}=4.46 \times 10^{-7} \\
& \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \underset{\substack{\text { Card } \\
\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}}}{ }+\mathrm{H}^{+} K_{\mathrm{a} 2}=4.69 \times 10^{-11}
\end{aligned}
$$

Its behavior as a diprotic acid appears anomalous at first, because the value of $K_{\mathrm{a} 1}$ is about $10^{2}$ to $10^{4}$ times smaller than $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for other carboxylic acids.

| $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$ | $\mathrm{HCO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$ |
| :---: | :---: |
| Acetic acid | Formic acid |
| $K_{\mathrm{a}}=1.75 \times 10^{-5}$ | $K_{\mathrm{a}}=1.80 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| $\mathrm{~N} \equiv \mathrm{CCH}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$ | $\mathrm{HOCH}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$ |
| Cyanoacetic acid | Glycolic acid |
| $K_{\mathrm{a}}=3.37 \times 10^{-3}$ | $K_{\mathrm{a}}=1.48 \times 10^{-4}$ |

The reason for this anomaly is not that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is unusual but, rather, that the value commonly given for $K_{\mathrm{a} 1}$ applies to the equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{All} \text { dissolved } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
( & \left.=\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right) \\
K_{\mathrm{a} 1} & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}=4.46 \times 10^{-7}
\end{aligned}
$$

Only about $0.2 \%$ of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is in the form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. When the true value of $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$ is used instead of the value $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}+\right. \left.\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)\right]$, the value of the equilibrium constant becomes

$$
K_{\mathrm{a} 1}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]}=2 \times 10^{-4}
$$

The hydration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) and dehydration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ are slow reactions that can be demonstrated in a classroom. ${ }^{27}$ Living cells utilize the enzyme carbonic anhydrase to speed the rate at which $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibrate in order to process this key metabolite. The enzyme provides an environment just right for the reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, lowering the activation energy (the energy barrier for the reaction) from 50 down to $26 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ and increasing the rate of reaction by more than a factor of $10^{6}$.

Carbonic acid has limited stability in aqueous solution and is not well characterized. The dimer $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ or oligomers $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)_{n}$ appear to exist in the solid state. ${ }^{28}$

## Relation Between $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{a}}$ and $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{b}}$

A most important relation exists between $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ of a conjugate acid-base pair in aqueous solution. We can derive this result with the acid HA and its conjugate base $\mathrm{A}^{-}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{HA} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A} & K_{\mathrm{a}} & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]} \\
\frac{\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HA}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}} & K_{\mathrm{b}} & =\frac{[\mathrm{HA}]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]} \\
K_{\mathrm{w}} & =K_{\mathrm{a}} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b}} \\
& =\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}{[\mathrm{HA}]} \cdot \frac{[\mathrm{HA}]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{A}^{-}\right]}
\end{array}
$$

Relation between $K_{a}$ and $K_{b}$ for a conjugate pair:

When the reactions are added, their equilibrium constants are multiplied to give

$$
K_{\mathrm{a}} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b}}=K_{\mathrm{w}}
$$

Equation 6-35 applies to any acid and its conjugate base in aqueous solution.

## EXAMPLE Finding $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{b}}$ for the Conjugate Base

$K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for acetic acid is $1.75 \times 10^{-5}$ (Reaction 6-26). Find $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ for acetate ion.
Solution This one is trivial: ${ }^{\dagger}$

$$
K_{\mathrm{b}}=\frac{K_{\mathrm{w}}}{K_{\mathrm{a}}}=\frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.75 \times 10^{-5}}=5.7 \times 10^{-10}
$$

Test Yourself $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for chloroacetic acid is $1.36 \times 10^{-3}$. Find $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ for chloroacetate ion. (Answer: $7.4 \times 10^{-12}$ )

## EXAMPLE Finding $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{a}}$ for the Conjugate Acid

$K_{\mathrm{b}}$ for methylamine is $4.47 \times 10^{-4}$ (Reaction 6-27). Find $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for methylammonium ion.
Solution Once again,

$$
K_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{K_{\mathrm{w}}}{K_{\mathrm{b}}}=2.2 \times 10^{-11}
$$

Test Yourself $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ for dimethylamine is $5.9 \times 10^{-4}$. Find $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ for dimethylammonium ion. (Answer: $1.7 \times 10^{-11}$ )

For a diprotic acid, we can derive relationships between each of two acids and their conjugate bases:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HA}^{-} & K_{\mathrm{a} 1} \\
\mathrm{HA}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} & K_{\mathrm{b} 2} \\
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} & K_{\mathrm{w}}
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{array}{r}
\mathrm{HA}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{2-} \\
\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{a} 2} \\
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
\end{array} \quad \begin{aligned}
& K_{\mathrm{b} 1} \\
& K_{\mathrm{w}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The final results are
General relation
between $K_{a}$ and $K_{b}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& K_{\mathrm{a} 1} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 2}=K_{\mathrm{w}} \\
& K_{\mathrm{a} 2} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 1}=K_{\mathrm{w}}
\end{aligned}
$$

[^2]$K_{\mathrm{a}} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b}}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$ for a conjugate acid-base pair in aqueous solution.

Challenge Derive the following results for a triprotic acid:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& K_{\mathrm{a} 1} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 3}=K_{\mathrm{w}} \\
& K_{\mathrm{a} 2} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 2}=K_{\mathrm{w}} \\
& K_{\mathrm{a} 3} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 1}=K_{\mathrm{w}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Shorthand for Organic Structures

We are beginning to encounter organic (carbon-containing) compounds in this book. Chemists and biochemists use simple conventions for drawing molecules to avoid writing every atom. Each vertex of a structure is understood to be a carbon atom, unless otherwise labeled. In the shorthand, we usually omit bonds from carbon to hydrogen. Carbon forms four chemical bonds. If you see carbon forming fewer than four bonds, the remaining bonds are assumed to go to hydrogen atoms that are not written. Here is an example:

Benzene, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}$, has two equivalent resonance structures, so all $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds are equivalent. We often draw benzene rings with a circle in place of three double bonds.

The shorthand shows that the carbon atom at the top right of the six-membered benzene ring forms three bonds to other carbon atoms (one single bond and one double bond), so there must be a hydrogen atom attached to this carbon atom. The carbon atom at the left side of the benzene ring forms three bonds to other carbon atoms and one bond to an oxygen atom. There is no hidden hydrogen atom attached to this carbon. In the $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group adjacent to nitrogen, both hydrogen atoms are omitted in the shorthand structure.

## Summary

For the reaction $a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}$, the equilibrium constant is $K=[\mathrm{C}]^{c}[\mathrm{D}]^{d} /[\mathrm{A}]^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]^{b}$. Solute concentrations should be expressed in moles per liter; gas concentrations should be in bars; and the concentrations of pure solids, liquids, and solvents are omitted. If the direction of a reaction is changed, $K^{\prime}=1 / K$. If two reactions are added, $K_{3}=K_{1} K_{2}$. The equilibrium constant can be calculated from the free-energy change for a chemical reaction: $K=\mathrm{e}^{-\Delta G^{\circ} / R T}$. The equation $\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S$ summarizes the observations that a
reaction is favored if it liberates heat (exothermic, negative $\Delta H$ ) or increases disorder (positive $\Delta S$ ). Le Châtelier's principle predicts the effect on a chemical reaction when reactants or products are added or temperature is changed. The reaction quotient, $Q$, tells how a system must change to reach equilibrium.

The solubility product is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of a solid salt into its constituent ions in aqueous solution. The common ion effect is the observation that, if one of the ions of that
salt is already present in the solution, the solubility of a salt is decreased. Sometimes, we can selectively precipitate one ion from a solution containing other ions by adding a suitable counterion. At high concentration of ligand, a precipitated metal ion may redissolve by forming soluble complex ions. In a metal-ion complex, the metal is a Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor) and the ligand is a Lewis base (electron pair donor).

Brønsted-Lowry acids are proton donors, and Brønsted-Lowry bases are proton acceptors. An acid increases the concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$in aqueous solution, and a base increases the concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. An acid-base pair related through the gain or loss of a single proton is described as conjugate. When a proton is transferred from one molecule to another molecule of a protic solvent, the reaction is called autoprotolysis.

The definition $\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$will be modified to include activity later. $K_{\mathrm{a}}$ is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid: $\mathrm{HA}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-}$. The base hydrolysis constant for the reaction $\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{BH}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is $K_{\mathrm{b}}$. When either $K_{\mathrm{a}}$
or $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ is large, the acid or base is said to be strong; otherwise, the acid or base is weak. Common strong acids and bases are listed in Table 6-2, which you should memorize. The most common weak acids are carboxylic acids $\left(\mathrm{RCO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right)$, and the most common weak bases are amines ( $\mathrm{R}_{3} \mathrm{~N}$ :). Carboxylate anions ( $\mathrm{RCO}_{2}^{-}$) are weak bases, and ammonium ions $\left(\mathrm{R}_{3} \mathrm{NH}^{+}\right)$are weak acids. Metal cations are weak acids. For a conjugate acid-base pair in water, $K_{\mathrm{a}} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b}}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$. For polyprotic acids, we denote successive acid dissociation constants as $K_{\mathrm{a} 1}, K_{\mathrm{a} 2}, K_{\mathrm{a} 3}, \cdots$, or just $K_{1}, K_{2}, K_{3}, \cdots$. For polybasic species, we denote successive hydrolysis constants $K_{\mathrm{b} 1}, K_{\mathrm{b} 2}, K_{\mathrm{b} 3}, \cdots$. For a diprotic system, the relations between successive acid and base equilibrium constants are $K_{\mathrm{a} 1} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 2}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{a} 2} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 1}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$. For a triprotic system, the relations are $K_{\mathrm{a} 1} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 3}=K_{\mathrm{w}}, K_{\mathrm{a} 2} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 2}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$, and $K_{\mathrm{a} 3} \cdot K_{\mathrm{b} 1}=K_{\mathrm{w}}$.

In the chemists' shorthand for organic structures, each vertex is a carbon atom. If fewer than four bonds to that carbon are shown, it is understood that H atoms are attached to the carbon so that it makes four bonds.

## Exercises

6-A. Consider the following equilibria in aqueous solution:
(1) $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{AgCl}(a q) K=2.0 \times 10^{3}$
(2) $\mathrm{AgCl}(a q)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{AgCl}_{2}^{-} K=9.3 \times 10^{1}$
(3) $\mathrm{AgCl}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} K=1.8 \times 10^{-10}$
(a) Calculate the numerical value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{AgCl}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{AgCl}(a q)$.
(b) Calculate the concentration of $\mathrm{AgCl}(a q)$ in equilibrium with excess undissolved solid AgCl .
(c) Find the numerical value of $K$ for the reaction $\mathrm{AgCl}_{2}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{AgCl}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

6-B. Reaction 6-7 is allowed to come to equilibrium in a solution initially containing $0.0100 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}, 0.0100 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$, and $1.00 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}^{+}$. To find the concentrations at equilibrium, we can construct a table showing initial and final concentrations (see below). We use the stoichiometry coefficients of the reaction to say that if $x \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ are created, then we must also make $x$ mol of $\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}$ and $8 x$ mol of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. To produce $x \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$, we must have consumed $x \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}$and $2 x \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$.
(a) Write the equilibrium constant expression that you would use to solve for $x$ to find the concentrations at equilibrium. Do not try to solve the equation.
(b) Because $K=1 \times 10^{11}$, we suppose that the reaction will go nearly "to completion." That is, we expect both the concentration of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$and $\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}$ to be close to 0.00500 M at equilibrium. (Why?) That is, $x \approx 0.00500 \mathrm{M}$. With this value of $x,\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.00+8 x=$ 1.04 M and $\left[\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}\right]=0.0100-x=0.0050 \mathrm{M}$. However, we cannot say $\left[\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\right]=0.0100-2 x=0$, because there must be some small concentration of $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ at equilibrium. Write $\left[\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\right]$ for the concentration of $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ and solve for $\left[\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}\right]$. The limiting reagent in this example is $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$. The reaction uses up $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ before consuming $\mathrm{BrO}_{3}^{-}$.

6-C. Find $\left[\mathrm{La}^{3+}\right]$ in the solution when excess solid lanthanum iodate, $\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{IO}_{3}\right)_{3}$, is stirred with $0.050 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{LiIO}_{3}$ until the system reaches equilibrium. Assume that $\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}$from $\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{IO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ is negligible compared with $\mathrm{IO}_{3}^{-}$from $\mathrm{LiIO}_{3}$.

6-D. Which will be more soluble (moles of metal dissolved per liter of solution), $\mathrm{Ba}\left(\mathrm{IO}_{3}\right)_{2}\left(K_{\text {sp }}=1.5 \times 10^{-9}\right)$ or $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{IO}_{3}\right)_{2}\left(K_{\text {sp }}=\right. 7.1 \times 10^{-7}$ )? Give an example of a chemical reaction that might occur that would reverse the predicted solubilities.

6-E. Fe(III) precipitates from acidic solution by addition of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to form $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}(s)$. At what concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$will $[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})]$ be reduced to $1.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ ? If Fe (II) is used instead, what concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$will reduce $[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})]$ to $1.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ ?

6-F. Is it possible to precipitate $99.0 \%$ of $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ by adding oxalate $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}^{2-}\right)$ without precipitating $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ?

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{CaC}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4} & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=1.3 \times 10^{-8} \\
\mathrm{Ce}_{2}\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)_{3} & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=5.9 \times 10^{-30}
\end{array}
$$

6-G. For a solution of $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ and ethylenediamine, the following equilibrium constants apply at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ :

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}+\underset{\substack{\text { Ethylenediamine } \\
\text { (abbreviated en) }}}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NH}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})^{2+}} & \log K_{1}=7.52 \\
\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})^{2+}+\mathrm{en} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{2}^{2+} & \log K_{2}=6.32 \\
\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{2}^{2+}+\mathrm{en} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{3}^{2+} & \log K_{3}=4.49
\end{array}
$$

Calculate the concentration of free $\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ in a solution prepared by mixing 0.100 mol of en plus 1.00 mL of $0.0100 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ and diluting to 1.00 L with dilute base (which keeps all the en in its unprotonated form. Assume that nearly all nickel is in the form $\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{3}^{2+}$, so $\left[\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{3}^{2+}\right]=1.00 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{M}$. Calculate the concentrations of $\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en})_{2}^{2+}$ to verify that they are negligible in comparison with $\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{en}){ }_{3}^{2+}$.

## Problems

## Equilibrium and Thermodynamics

6-1. To evaluate the equilibrium constant in Equation 6-2, we must express concentrations of solutes in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$, gases in bars, and omit solids, liquids, and solvents. Explain why.

6-2. Why do we say that the equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$(or any other reaction) is dimensionless?

6-3. Explain the statement that predictions about the direction of a reaction based on Gibbs free energy or Le Châtelier's principle are thermodynamic, not kinetic.

6-4. Write the expression for the equilibrium constant for each of the following reactions. Write the pressure of a gaseous molecule, X , as $P_{\mathrm{X}}$.
(a) $3 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}(a q) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ag}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}(s)$
(b) $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}(l)+\frac{15}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l)+6 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)$

6-5. For the reaction $2 \mathrm{~A}(g)+\mathrm{B}(a q)+3 \mathrm{C}(l) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{D}(s)+3 \mathrm{E}(g)$, the concentrations at equilibrium are found to be

6-6. From the equations

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{HOCl} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OCl}^{-} & K=3.0 \times 10^{-8} \\
\mathrm{HOCl}+\mathrm{OBr}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HOBr}+\mathrm{OCl}^{-} & K=15
\end{array}
$$

find the value of $K$ for the reaction $\mathrm{HOBr} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OBr}^{-}$.

6-7. (a) A favorable entropy change occurs when $\Delta S$ is positive. Does the order of the system increase or decrease when $\Delta S$ is positive?
(b) A favorable enthalpy change occurs when $\Delta H$ is negative. Does the system absorb heat or give off heat when $\Delta H$ is negative?
(c) Write the relation between $\Delta G, \Delta H$, and $\Delta S$. Use the results of parts (a) and (b) to state whether $\Delta G$ must be positive or negative for a spontaneous change.
6-8. For the reaction $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}, \Delta G^{\circ}=+59.0 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ at 298.15 K . Find the value of $K$ for the reaction.

6-9. The formation of tetrafluoroethylene from its elements is highly exothermic:

$$
\underset{\text { Fluorine }}{2 \mathrm{~F}_{2}(g)}+\underset{\text { Graphite }}{2 \mathrm{C}(s)} \rightleftharpoons \underset{\text { Tetrafluoroethylene }}{\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{CF}_{2}(g)}
$$

(a) If a mixture of $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, graphite, and $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~F}_{4}$ is at equilibrium in a closed container, will the reaction go to the right or to the left if $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ is added?
(b) Rare bacteria from the planet Teflon eat $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{~F}_{4}$ and make Teflon for their cell walls. Will the reaction go to the right or to the left if these bacteria are added?

(c) Will the reaction go right or left if solid graphite is added? (Neglect any effect of increased pressure due to the decreased volume in the vessel when solid is added.)
(d) Will the reaction go right or left if the container is crushed to one-eighth of its original volume?
(e) Does the equilibrium constant become larger or smaller if the container is heated?

6-10. $\mathrm{BaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(s)$ loses water when it is heated in an oven:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{BaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{BaCl}_{2}(s)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(g) \\
\Delta H^{\circ}=63.11 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
\Delta S^{\circ}=+148 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{~mol}) \text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{gathered}
$$

(a) Write the equilibrium constant for this reaction. Calculate the vapor pressure of gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\left(P_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$ above $\mathrm{BaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at 298 K .
(b) If $\Delta H^{\circ}$ and $\Delta S^{\circ}$ are not temperature dependent (a poor assumption), estimate the temperature at which $P_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ above $\mathrm{BaCl}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(s)$ will be 1 bar.

6-11. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}(a q)+ \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is $K_{\mathrm{b}}=1.479 \times 10^{-5}$ at $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $1.570 \times 10^{-5}$ at $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(a) Assuming $\Delta H^{\circ}$ and $\Delta S^{\circ}$ are constant in the interval $5^{\circ}-10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (probably a good assumption for small $\Delta T$ ), use Equation 6-8 to find $\Delta H^{\circ}$ for the reaction in this temperature range.
(b) Describe how Equation 6-8 could be used to make a linear graph to determine $\Delta H^{\circ}$, if $\Delta H^{\circ}$ and $\Delta S^{\circ}$ were constant over some temperature range.

6-12. For $\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)+\mathrm{Br}_{2}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HBr}(g), K=7.2 \times 10^{-4}$ at 1362 K and $\Delta H^{\circ}$ is positive. A vessel is charged with $48.0 \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{HBr}, 1370 \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $3310 \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{Br}_{2}$ at 1362 K .
(a) Will the reaction proceed to the left or the right to reach equilibrium?
(b) Calculate the pressure (in pascals) of each species in the vessel at equilibrium.
(c) If the mixture at equilibrium is compressed to half of its original volume, will the reaction proceed to the left or the right to reestablish equilibrium?
(d) If the mixture at equilibrium is heated from 1362 to 1407 K , will HBr be formed or consumed in order to reestablish equilibrium?

6-13. Henry's law states that the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to the pressure of the gas. This law is a consequence of the equilibrium

$$
\mathrm{X}(g) \stackrel{K_{\mathrm{h}}}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{X}(a q) \quad K_{\mathrm{h}}=\frac{[\mathrm{X}]}{P_{\mathrm{X}}}
$$

where $K_{\mathrm{h}}$ is called the Henry's law constant. (The same law applies to other solvents, but the value of $K_{\mathrm{h}}$ is different for each solvent.) For the gasoline additive MTBE, $K_{\mathrm{h}}=1.71 \mathrm{M} / \mathrm{bar}$. Suppose we have a closed container with aqueous solution and air in equilibrium. If the concentration of MTBE in the water is $1.00 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{ppm}(=100 \mu \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{MTBE} / \mathrm{g}$ solution $\approx 100 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), what is the pressure of MTBE in the air?

## Solubility Product

6-14. Find the concentration of $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$in equilibrium with $\mathrm{CuBr}(s)$ and $0.10 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Br}^{-}$.

6-15. What concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{4-}$ (ferrocyanide) is in equilibrium with $1.0 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ag}_{4} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}(s)$. Express your answer with a prefix from Table 1-3.

6-16. Find $\left[\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right]$ in a solution saturated with $\mathrm{Cu}_{4}(\mathrm{OH})_{6}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$ if $\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]$is fixed at $1.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$. Note that $\mathrm{Cu}_{4}(\mathrm{OH})_{6}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$ gives 1 mol of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ for 4 mol of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$.

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\mathrm{Cu}_{4}(\mathrm{OH})_{6}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)(s) \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+6 \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-} \\
K_{\mathrm{sp}}=2.3 \times 10^{-69}
\end{array}
$$

6-17. (a) From the solubility product of zinc ferrocyanide, $\mathrm{Zn}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}$, calculate the concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}^{4-}$ in 0.10 mM $\mathrm{ZnSO}_{4}$ saturated with $\mathrm{Zn}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}$. Assume that $\mathrm{Zn}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}$ is a negligible source of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$.
(b) What concentration of $\mathrm{K}_{4} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}$ should be in a suspension of solid $\mathrm{Zn}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}$ in water to give $\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right]=5.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ ?
6-18. Solubility products predict that cation $\mathrm{A}^{3+}$ can be $99.999 \%$ separated from cation $\mathrm{B}^{2+}$ by precipitation with anion $\mathrm{X}^{-}$. When the separation is tried, we find $0.2 \%$ contamination of $\mathrm{AX}_{3}(s)$ with $\mathrm{B}^{2+}$. Explain what might be happening.
6-19. A solution contains $0.0500 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $0.0300 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$. Can $99 \%$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ be precipitated by sulfate without precipitating $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$? What will be the concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ when $\mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ begins to precipitate?
6-20. A solution contains $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ and $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}$. Can $99.90 \%$ of either ion be precipitated by chromate $\left(\mathrm{CrO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$ without precipitating the other metal ion?

6-24. The cumulative formation constant for $\mathrm{SnCl}_{2}(a q)$ in 1.0 M $\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ is $\beta_{2}=12$. Find the concentration of $\mathrm{SnCl}_{2}(a q)$ for a solution in which the concentrations of $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are both somehow fixed at 0.20 M .

6-25. Given the following equilibria, calculate the concentration of each zinc species in a solution saturated with $\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s)$ and containing [ $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$] at a fixed concentration of $3.2 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s) & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=3 \times 10^{-16} \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})^{+} & \beta_{1}=1 \times 10^{4} \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(a q) & \beta_{2}=2 \times 10^{10} \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}^{-} & \beta_{3}=8 \times 10^{13} \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}^{2-} & \beta_{4}=3 \times 10^{15}
\end{array}
$$

6-26. Although $\mathrm{KOH}, \mathrm{RbOH}$, and CsOH have little association between metal and hydroxide in aqueous solution, $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$do form complexes with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Li}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{LiOH}(a q) & K_{1}=\frac{[\mathrm{LiOH}(a q)]}{\left[\mathrm{Li}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right]}=0.83 \\
\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{NaOH}(a q) & K_{1}=0.20
\end{array}
$$

Prepare a table like the one in Exercise 6-B showing initial and final concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{NaOH}(a q)$ in 1 F NaOH
solution. Calculate the fraction of sodium in the form $\mathrm{NaOH}(a q)$ at equilibrium.

6-27. In Figure 6-3, the concentration of $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)$ is independent of $\left[\mathrm{I}^{-}\right]$. Use any of the equilibrium constants for Reactions 6-11 through 6-15 to find the equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(s) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)$, which is equal to the concentration of $\mathrm{PbI}_{2}(a q)$.

## Acids and Bases

6-28. Distinguish Lewis acids and bases from Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases. Give an example of each.

6-29. Fill in the blanks:
(a) The product of a reaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is called $\_\_\_\_$ .
(b) The bond between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is called
$\_\_\_\_$ or $\_\_\_\_$ .
(c) Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases related by gain or loss of one proton are said to be $\_\_\_\_$ .
(d) A solution is acidic if $\_\_\_\_$ . A solution is basic if $\_\_\_\_$ .
6-30. Why is the pH of distilled water usually $<7$ ? How can you prevent this from happening?

6-31. Gaseous $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ is created by combustion of sulfur-containing fuels, especially coal. Explain how $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ in the atmosphere makes acidic rain.

6-32. Use electron dot structures to show why tetramethylammonium hydroxide, $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+} \mathrm{OH}^{-}$, is an ionic compound. That is, show why hydroxide is not covalently bound to the rest of the molecule.

6-33. Identify the Brønsted-Lowry acids among the reactants in the following reactions:
(a) $\mathrm{KCN}+\mathrm{HI} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCN}+\mathrm{KI}$
(b) $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$

6-34. Write the autoprotolysis reaction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$.
6-35. Identify the conjugate acid-base pairs in the following reactions:
(a) $\mathrm{H}_{3} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$
(b)

## pH

6-36. Calculate $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$and pH for the following solutions:
(a) $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$
(d) 3.0 M HCl
(b) 0.035 M KOH
(e) $0.010 \mathrm{M}\left[\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+}\right] \mathrm{OH}^{-}$
(c) 0.030 M HCl
Tetramethylammonium hydroxide

6-37. Use Table 6-1 to calculate the pH of pure water at (a) $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and (b) $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

6-38. The equilibrium constant for the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ is $1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the value of $K$ for the reaction $4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 \mathrm{OH}^{-}$?
6-39. An acidic solution containing $0.010 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{La}^{3+}$ is treated with NaOH until $\mathrm{La}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ precipitates. At what pH does this occur?
6-40. Use Le Châtelier's principle and $K_{\mathrm{w}}$ in Table 6-1 to decide whether the autoprotolysis of water is endothermic or exothermic at
(a) $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$;
(b) $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$;
(c) $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

6-52. (a) Using only $K_{\mathrm{sp}}$ from Table 6-3, calculate how many moles of $\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ will dissolve in 1.00 L of water.

6-53. The planet Aragonose (which is made mostly of the mineral aragonite, whose composition is $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ ) has an atmosphere containing methane and carbon dioxide, each at a pressure of 0.10 bar. The oceans are saturated with aragonite and have a concentration of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$equal to $1.8 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$. Given the following equilibria, calculate how many grams of calcium are contained in 2.00 L of Aragonose seawater.

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}
\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s, \text { aragonite }) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(a q)+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}(a q) & K_{\mathrm{sp}}=6.0 \times 10^{-9} \\
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q) & K_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=3.4 \times 10^{-2} \\
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(a q)+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(l) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q)+\mathrm{H}^{+}(a q) & K_{1}=4.5 \times 10^{-7} \\
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(a q) & \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}(a q)+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}(a q) & K_{2}=4.7 \times 10^{-11}
\end{array}
$$

Don't panic! Reverse the first reaction, add all the reactions together, and see what cancels.


[^0]:    ${ }^{\dagger}$ The definition of the standard state contains subtleties beyond the scope of this book. For Reaction 6-3, the standard state of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is the hypothetical state in which each ion is present at a concentration of 1 M but behaves as if it were in an infinitely dilute solution. That is, the standard concentration is 1 M , but the standard behavior is what would be observed in a very dilute solution in which each ion is unaffected by surrounding ions.

[^1]:    a. For $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, only the first proton ionization is complete. Dissociation of the second proton has an equilibrium constant of $1.0 \times 10^{-2}$.
    b. This is a general formula for any hydroxide salt of an ammonium cation containing four organic groups. An example is tetrabutylammonium hydroxide:
    $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{4} \mathrm{~N}^{+} \mathrm{OH}^{-}$.

[^2]:    ${ }^{\dagger}$ In this text, we use $K_{\mathrm{w}}=10^{-14.00}=1.0 \times 10^{-14}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The more accurate value from Table 6-1 is $K_{\mathrm{w}}=10^{-13.995}$. For acetic acid with $K_{\mathrm{a}}=10^{-4.756}$, the accurate value of $K_{\mathrm{b}}$ is $10^{-(13.995-4.756)}=10^{-9.239}= 5.77 \times 10^{-10}$.
