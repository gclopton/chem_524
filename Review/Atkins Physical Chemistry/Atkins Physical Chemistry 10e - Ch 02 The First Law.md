## CHAPTER 2

## The First Law

The release of energy can be used to provide heat when a fuel burns in a furnace，to produce mechanical work when a fuel burns in an engine，and to generate electrical work when a chemical reaction pumps electrons through a circuit．In chem－ istry，we encounter reactions that can be harnessed to provide heat and work，reactions that liberate energy that is unused but which give products we require，and reactions that constitute the processes of life．Thermodynamics，the study of the trans－ formations of energy，enables us to discuss all these matters quantitatively and to make useful predictions．

## 2A Internal energy

First，we examine the ways in which a system can exchange energy with its surroundings in terms of the work it may do or have done on it or the heat that it may produce or absorb．These considerations lead to the definition of the＇internal energy＇，the total energy of a system，and the formulation of the＇First Law＇ of thermodynamics，which states that the internal energy of an isolated system is constant．

## 2B Enthalpy

The second major concept of the chapter is＇enthalpy＇，which is a very useful book－keeping property for keeping track of the heat output（or requirements）of physical processes and chemical reactions that take place at constant pressure．Experimentally， changes in internal energy or enthalpy may be measured by techniques known collectively as＇calorimetry＇．

## 2C Thermochemistry

＇Thermochemistry＇is the study of heat transactions dur－ ing chemical reactions．We describe both computational and
experimental methods for the determination of enthalpy changes associated with both physical and chemical changes．

## 2D State functions and exact differentials

We also begin to unfold some of the power of thermodynamics by showing how to establish relations between different prop－ erties of a system．We see that one very useful aspect of ther－ modynamics is that a property can be measured indirectly by measuring others and then combining their values．The rela－ tions we derive also enable us to discuss the liquefaction of gases and to establish the relation between the heat capacities of a substance under different conditions．

## 2E Adiabatic changes

‘Adiabatic’ processes occur without transfer of energy as heat． We focus on adiabatic changes involving perfect gases because they figure prominently in our presentation of thermodynamics．

## What is the impact of this material？

Concepts of thermochemistry apply to the chemical reactions associated with the conversion of food into energy in organisms， and so form a basis for the discussion of bioenergetics．In Impact I2．1，we explore some of the thermochemical calculations related to the metabolism of fats，carbohydrates，and proteins．

Why do you need to know this material?
The First Law of thermodynamics is the foundation of the discussion of the role of energy in chemistry. Wherever we are interested in the generation or use of energy in physical transformations or chemical reactions, lying in the background are the concepts introduced by the First Law.

## What is the key idea?

The total energy of an isolated system is constant.

- What do you need to know already?

This Topic makes use of the discussion of the properties of gases (Topic 1A), particularly the perfect gas law. It builds on the definition of work given in Foundations B.

For the purposes of thermodynamics, the universe is divided into two parts, the system and its surroundings. The system is the part of the world in which we have a special interest. It may be a reaction vessel, an engine, an electrochemical cell, a biological cell, and so on. The surroundings comprise the region outside the system and are where we make our measurements. The type of system depends on the characteristics of the boundary that divides it from the surroundings (Fig. 2A.1). If matter can be transferred through the boundary between the system and its surroundings the system is classified as open. If matter cannot pass through the boundary the system is classified as closed. Both open and closed systems can exchange energy with their surroundings. For example, a closed system can expand and thereby raise a weight in the surroundings; a closed system may also transfer energy to the surroundings if they are at a lower temperature. An isolated system is a closed system that has neither mechanical nor thermal contact with its surroundings.

## 2A. 1 Work, heat, and energy

Although thermodynamics deals with observations on bulk systems, it is immeasurably enriched by understanding the molecular origins of these observations. In each case we shall set out the bulk observations on which thermodynamics is based and then describe their molecular interpretations.

## (a) Operational definitions

The fundamental physical property in thermodynamics is work: work is done to achieve motion against an opposing force. A simple example is the process of raising a weight against the pull of gravity. A process does work if in principle it can be harnessed to raise a weight somewhere in the surroundings. An example of doing work is the expansion of a gas that pushes out a piston: the motion of the piston can in principle be used to raise a weight. A chemical reaction that drives an electric current through a resistance also does work, because the same current could be passed through a motor and used to raise a weight.

The energy of a system is its capacity to do work. When work is done on an otherwise isolated system (for instance, by compressing a gas or winding a spring), the capacity of the system to do work is increased; in other words, the energy of the system is increased. When the system does work (i.e. when the piston moves out or the spring unwinds), the energy of the system is reduced and it can do less work than before.

Experiments have shown that the energy of a system may be changed by means other than work itself. When the energy of a system changes as a result of a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings we say that energy has been transferred as heat. When a heater is immersed in a beaker of water (the system), the capacity of the system to do work increases because hot water can be used to do more work than the same amount of cold water. Not all boundaries permit the transfer of energy even though there is a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. Boundaries that do permit the transfer of energy as heat are called diathermic; those that do not are called adiabatic.

An exothermic process is a process that releases energy as heat into its surroundings. All combustion reactions are exothermic. An endothermic process is a process in which energy is acquired from its surroundings as heat. An example of an endothermic process is the vaporization of water. To avoid a lot of awkward language, we say that in an exothermic process energy is transferred 'as heat' to the surroundings and in an endothermic process energy is transferred 'as heat' from the surroundings into the system. However, it must never be forgotten that heat is a process (the transfer of energy as a result of a temperature difference), not an entity. An endothermic process in a diathermic container results in
energy flowing into the system as heat to restore the temperature to that of the surroundings. An exothermic process in a similar diathermic container results in a release of energy as heat into the surroundings. When an endothermic process takes place in an adiabatic container, it results in a lowering of temperature of the system; an exothermic process results in a rise of temperature. These features are summarized in Fig. 2A.2.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-03.jpg?height=550&width=878&top_left_y=747&top_left_x=1207)
Figure 2A. 2 (a) When an endothermic process occurs in an adiabatic system, the temperature falls; (b) if the process is exothermic, then the temperature rises. (c) When an endothermic process occurs in a diathermic container, energy enters as heat from the surroundings, and the system remains at the same temperature. (d) If the process is exothermic, then energy leaves as heat, and the process is isothermal.

## Brief illustration 2A. 1 <br> Combustions in adiabatic and diathermic containers

Combustions are chemical reactions in which substances react with oxygen, normally with a flame. An example is the combustion of methane gas, $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})$ :

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})
$$

All combustions are exothermic. Although the temperature typically rises in the course of the combustion, if we wait long enough, the system returns to the temperature of its surroundings so we can speak of a combustion 'at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ', for instance. If the combustion takes place in an adiabatic container, the energy released as heat remains inside the container and results in a permanent rise in temperature.

## (b) The molecular interpretation of heat and work

In molecular terms, heating is the transfer of energy that makes use of disorderly, apparently random, molecular motion in the surroundings. The disorderly motion of molecules is called thermal motion. The thermal motion of the molecules in the hot surroundings stimulates the molecules in the cooler system to move more vigorously and, as a result, the energy of the system is increased. When a system heats its surroundings, molecules of the system stimulate the thermal motion of the molecules in the surroundings (Fig. 2A.3).

In contrast, work is the transfer of energy that makes use of organized motion in the surroundings (Fig. 2A.4). When a weight is raised or lowered, its atoms move in an organized way (up or down). The atoms in a spring move in an orderly way

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-04.jpg?height=516&width=552&top_left_y=1068&top_left_x=403)
Figure 2A. 3 When energy is transferred to the surroundings as heat, the transfer stimulates random motion of the atoms in the surroundings. Transfer of energy from the surroundings to the system makes use of random motion (thermal motion) in the surroundings.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-04.jpg?height=513&width=552&top_left_y=1868&top_left_x=403)
Figure 2A. 4 When a system does work, it stimulates orderly motion in the surroundings. For instance, the atoms shown here may be part of a weight that is being raised. The ordered motion of the atoms in a falling weight does work on the system.

when it is wound; the electrons in an electric current move in the same direction. When a system does work it causes atoms or electrons in its surroundings to move in an organized way. Likewise, when work is done on a system, molecules in the surroundings are used to transfer energy to it in an organized way, as the atoms in a weight are lowered or a current of electrons is passed.

The distinction between work and heat is made in the surroundings. The fact that a falling weight may stimulate thermal motion in the system is irrelevant to the distinction between heat and work: work is identified as energy transfer making use of the organized motion of atoms in the surroundings, and heat is identified as energy transfer making use of thermal motion in the surroundings. In the adiabatic compression of a gas, for instance, work is done on the system as the atoms of the compressing weight descend in an orderly way, but the effect of the incoming piston is to accelerate the gas molecules to higher average speeds. Because collisions between molecules quickly randomize their directions, the orderly motion of the atoms of the weight is in effect stimulating thermal motion in the gas. We observe the falling weight, the orderly descent of its atoms, and report that work is being done even though it is stimulating thermal motion.

## 2A.2 The definition of internal energy

In thermodynamics, the total energy of a system is called its internal energy, $U$. The internal energy is the total kinetic and potential energy of the constituents (the atoms, ions, or molecules) of the system. It does not include the kinetic energy arising from the motion of the system as a whole, such as its kinetic energy as it accompanies the Earth on its orbit round the Sun. That is, the internal energy is the energy 'internal' to the system. We denote by $\Delta U$ the change in internal energy when a system changes from an initial state i with internal energy $U_{\mathrm{i}}$ to a final state f of internal energy $U_{\mathrm{f}}$ :

$$
\Delta U=U_{\mathrm{f}}-U_{\mathrm{i}}
$$

Throughout thermodynamics, we use the convention that $\Delta X=X_{\mathrm{f}}-X_{\mathrm{i}}$, where $X$ is a property (a 'state function') of the system.

The internal energy is a state function in the sense that its value depends only on the current state of the system and is independent of how that state has been prepared. In other words, internal energy is a function of the properties that determine the current state of the system. Changing any one of the state variables, such as the pressure, results in a change in internal energy. That the internal energy is a state function has consequences of the greatest importance, as we shall start to unfold in Topic 2D.

The internal energy is an extensive property of a system (a property that depends on the amount of substance present, Foundations A) and is measures in joules ( $1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ ). The molar internal energy, $U_{\mathrm{m}}$, is the internal energy divided by the amount of substance in a system, $U_{\mathrm{m}}=U / n$; it is an intensive property (a property independent of the amount of substance) and commonly reported in kilojoules per mole $\left(\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}{ }^{-1}\right)$.

## (a) Molecular interpretation of internal energy

A molecule has a certain number of motional degrees of freedom, such as the ability to translate (the motion of its centre of mass through space), rotate around its centre of mass, or vibrate (as its bond lengths and angles change, leaving its centre of mass unmoved). Many physical and chemical properties depend on the energy associated with each of these modes of motion. For example, a chemical bond might break if a lot of energy becomes concentrated in it, for instance as vigorous vibration.

The 'equipartition theorem' of classical mechanics introduced in Foundations B can be used to predict the contributions of each mode of motion of a molecule to the total energy of a collection of non-interacting molecules (that is, of a perfect gas, and providing quantum effects can be ignored). For translation and rotational modes the contribution of a mode is proportional to the temperature, so the internal energy of a sample increases as the temperature is raised.

## Brief illustration 2A. 2 The internal energy of a perfect gas

In Foundations B it is shown that the mean energy of a molecule due to its translational motion is $\frac{3}{2} k T$ and therefore to the molar energy of a collection the contribution is $\frac{3}{2} R T$. Therefore, considering only the translational contribution to internal energy,

$$
U_{\mathrm{m}}(T)=U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)+\frac{3}{2} N_{\mathrm{A}} k T=U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)+\frac{3}{2} R T
$$

where $U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)$, the internal energy at $T=0$, can be greater than zero (see, for example, Chapter 8). At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, R T=2.48 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, so the translational motion contributes $3.72 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ to the molar internal energy of gases.

Self-test 2A.2 Calculate the molar internal energy of carbon dioxide at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, taking into account its translational and rotational degrees of freedom.

$$
\text { Answer: } U_{\mathrm{m}}(T)=U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)+\frac{5}{2} R T
$$

The contribution to the internal energy of a collection of perfect gas molecules is independent of the volume occupied by the molecules: there are no intermolecular interactions in a
perfect gas, so the distance between the molecules has no effect on the energy. That is, the internal energy of a perfect gas is independent of the volume it occupies.

The internal energy of interacting molecules in condensed phases also has a contribution from the potential energy of their interaction, but no simple expressions can be written down in general. Nevertheless, it remains true that as the temperature of a system is raised, the internal energy increases as the various modes of motion become more highly excited.

## (b) The formulation of the First Law

It has been found experimentally that the internal energy of a system may be changed either by doing work on the system or by heating it. Whereas we may know how the energy transfer has occurred (because we can see if a weight has been raised or lowered in the surroundings, indicating transfer of energy by doing work, or if ice has melted in the surroundings, indicating transfer of energy as heat), the system is blind to the mode employed. Heat and work are equivalent ways of changing a system's internal energy. A system is like a bank: it accepts deposits in either currency, but stores its reserves as internal energy. It is also found experimentally that if a system is isolated from its surroundings, then no change in internal energy takes place. This summary of observations is now known as the First Law of thermodynamics and is expressed as follows:

The internal energy of an isolated system is constant.
First Law of thermodynamics
We cannot use a system to do work, leave it isolated, and then come back expecting to find it restored to its original state with the same capacity for doing work. The experimental evidence for this observation is that no 'perpetual motion machine', a machine that does work without consuming fuel or using some other source of energy, has ever been built.

These remarks may be summarized as follows. If we write $w$ for the work done on a system, $q$ for the energy transferred as heat to a system, and $\Delta U$ for the resulting change in internal energy, then it follows that

$$
\Delta U=q+w \quad \text { Mathematical statement of the First Law }
$$

Equation 2A. 2 summarizes the equivalence of heat and work and the fact that the internal energy is constant in an isolated system (for which $q=0$ and $w=0$ ). The equation states that the change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the energy that passes through its boundary as heat or work. It employs the 'acquisitive convention', in which $w$ and $q$ are positive if energy is transferred to the system as work or heat and are negative if energy is lost from the system. In other words, we view the flow of energy as work or heat from the system's perspective.

## Brief illustration 2A. 3 Changes in internal energy

If an electric motor produced 15 kJ of energy each second as mechanical work and lost 2 kJ as heat to the surroundings, then the change in the internal energy of the motor each second is $\Delta U=-2 \mathrm{~kJ}-15 \mathrm{~kJ}=-17 \mathrm{~kJ}$. Suppose that, when a spring was wound, 100 J of work was done on it but 15 J escaped to the surroundings as heat. The change in internal energy of the spring is $\Delta U=100 \mathrm{~J}-15 \mathrm{~J}=+85 \mathrm{~J}$.

> A note on good practice Always include the sign of $\Delta U$ (and of $\Delta X$ in general), even if it is positive.

Self-test 2A. 3 A generator does work on an electric heater by forcing an electric current through it. Suppose 1 kJ of work is done on the heater and it heats its surroundings by 1 kJ . What is the change in internal energy of the heater?

Answer: 0

## 2A. 3 Expansion work

The way is opened to powerful methods of calculation by switching attention to infinitesimal changes of state (such as infinitesimal change in temperature) and infinitesimal changes in the internal energy $\mathrm{d} U$. Then, if the work done on a system is $\mathrm{d} w$ and the energy supplied to it as heat is $\mathrm{d} q$, in place of eqn 2A. 2 we have

$$
\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} q+\mathrm{d} w
$$

To use this expression we must be able to relate $\mathrm{d} q$ and $\mathrm{d} w$ to events taking place in the surroundings.

We begin by discussing expansion work, the work arising from a change in volume. This type of work includes the work done by a gas as it expands and drives back the atmosphere. Many chemical reactions result in the generation of gases (for instance, the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate or the combustion of octane), and the thermodynamic characteristics of the reaction depend on the work that must be done to make room for the gas it has produced. The term 'expansion work' also includes work associated with negative changes of volume, that is, compression.

## (a) The general expression for work

The calculation of expansion work starts from the definition used in physics, which states that the work required to move an object a distance $\mathrm{d} z$ against an opposing force of magnitude $|F|$ is

$$
\mathrm{d} w=-|F| \mathrm{d} z \quad \text { Definition Work done }
$$

The negative sign tells us that, when the system moves an object against an opposing force of magnitude $|F|$, and there are no
other changes, then the internal energy of the system doing the work will decrease. That is, if $\mathrm{d} z$ is positive (motion to positive $z), \mathrm{d} w$ is negative, and the internal energy decreases ( $\mathrm{d} U$ in eqn 2A. 3 is negative provided that $\mathrm{d} q=0$ ).

Now consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 2A.5, in which one wall of a system is a massless, frictionless, rigid, perfectly fitting piston of area $A$. If the external pressure is $p_{\mathrm{ex}}$, the magnitude of the force acting on the outer face of the piston is $|F|=p_{\text {ex }} A$. When the system expands through a distance $\mathrm{d} z$ against an external pressure $p_{\text {ex }}$, it follows that the work done is $\mathrm{d} w=-p_{\text {ex }} A \mathrm{~d} z$. The quantity $A \mathrm{~d} z$ is the change in volume, $\mathrm{d} V$, in the course of the expansion. Therefore, the work done when the system expands by $d V$ against a pressure $p_{\text {ex }}$ is

$$
\mathrm{d} w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \mathrm{~d} V
$$

Expansion work
(2A.5a)
To obtain the total work done when the volume changes from an initial value $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to a final value $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ we integrate this expression between the initial and final volumes:

$$
w=-\int_{V_{\mathrm{i}}}^{V_{\mathrm{f}}} p_{\mathrm{ex}} \mathrm{~d} V
$$

The force acting on the piston, $p_{\mathrm{ex}} A$, is equivalent to the force arising from a weight that is raised as the system expands. If the system is compressed instead, then the same weight is lowered in the surroundings and eqn 2A.5b can still be used, but now $V_{\mathrm{f}}<V_{\mathrm{i}}$. It is important to note that it is still the external pressure that determines the magnitude of the work. This somewhat perplexing conclusion seems to be inconsistent with the fact that the gas inside the container is opposing the compression. However, when a gas is compressed, the ability of the surroundings to do work is diminished by an amount determined by the weight that is lowered, and it is this energy that is transferred into the system.

Other types of work (for example, electrical work), which we shall call either non-expansion work or additional work, have

Figure 2A. 5 When a piston of area $A$ moves out through a distance $\mathrm{d} z$, it sweeps out a volume $\mathrm{d} V=A \mathrm{~d} z$. The external pressure $p_{\text {ex }}$ is equivalent to a weight pressing on the piston, and the magnitude of the force opposing expansion is $|F|=p_{\mathrm{ex}} A$.

analogous expressions, with each one the product of an intensive factor (the pressure, for instance) and an extensive factor (the change in volume). Some are collected in Table 2A.1. For the present we continue with the work associated with changing the volume, the expansion work, and see what we can extract from eqn 2A.5b.


## Brief illustration 2A. 4 The work of extension

To establish an expression for the work of stretching an elastomer, a polymer that can stretch and contract, to an extension $l$ given that the force opposing extension is proportional to the displacement from the resting state of the elastomer we write $|F|=k_{\mathrm{f}} x$, where $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ is a constant and $x$ is the displacement. It then follows from eqn 2A. 4 that for an infinitesimal displacement from $x$ to $x+\mathrm{d} x, \mathrm{~d} w=-k_{\mathrm{f}} x \mathrm{~d} x$. For the overall work of displacement from $x=0$ to the final extension $l$,

$$
w=-\int_{0}^{l} k_{\mathrm{f}} x \mathrm{~d} x=-\frac{1}{2} k_{\mathrm{f}} l^{2}
$$

Self-test 2A. 4 Suppose the restoring force weakens as the elastomer is stretched, and $k_{\mathrm{f}}(x)=a-b x^{1 / 2}$. Evaluate the work of extension to $l$.

$$
\text { Answer: } w=-\frac{1}{2} a l^{2}+\frac{2}{5} b l^{5 / 2}
$$

## (b) Expansion against constant pressure

Suppose that the external pressure is constant throughout the expansion. For example, the piston may be pressed on by the atmosphere, which exerts the same pressure throughout the expansion. A chemical example of this condition is the expansion of a gas formed in a chemical reaction in a container that can expand. We can evaluate eqn 2A.5b by taking the constant $p_{\text {ex }}$ outside the integral:

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-07.jpg?height=482&width=548&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=1371)
Figure 2A. 6 The work done by a gas when it expands against a constant external pressure, $p_{\text {ex }}$, is equal to the shaded area in this example of an indicator diagram.

$$
w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \int_{V_{\mathrm{i}}}^{V_{\mathrm{f}}} \mathrm{~d} V=-p_{\mathrm{ex}}\left(V_{\mathrm{f}}-V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)
$$

Therefore, if we write the change in volume as $\Delta V=V_{\mathrm{f}}-V_{\mathrm{i}}$,

$$
w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \Delta V \quad \text { Constant external pressure Expansion work }
$$

This result is illustrated graphically in Fig. 2A.6, which makes use of the fact that an integral can be interpreted as an area. The magnitude of $w$, denoted $|w|$, is equal to the area beneath the horizontal line at $p=p_{\text {ex }}$ lying between the initial and final volumes. A $p V$-graph used to illustrate expansion work is called an indicator diagram; James Watt first used one to indicate aspects of the operation of his steam engine.

Free expansion is expansion against zero opposing force. It occurs when $p_{\mathrm{ex}}=0$. According to eqn 2A.6,

$$
w=0
$$

Work of free expansion

That is, no work is done when a system expands freely. Expansion of this kind occurs when a gas expands into a vacuum.

## Example 2A. 1 Calculating the work of gas production

Calculate the work done when 50 g of iron reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce $\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})$ and hydrogen in (a) a closed vessel of fixed volume, (b) an open beaker at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Method We need to judge the magnitude of the volume change and then to decide how the process occurs. If there is no change in volume, there is no expansion work however the process takes place. If the system expands against a constant external pressure, the work can be calculated from eqn 2A.6. A general feature of processes in which a condensed phase changes into a gas is that the volume of the former may usually be neglected relative to that of the gas it forms.

Answer In (a) the volume cannot change, so no expansion work is done and $w=0$. In (b) the gas drives back the atmosphere and therefore $w=-p_{\text {ex }} \Delta V$. We can neglect the initial
volume because the final volume (after the production of gas) is so much larger and $\Delta V=V_{\mathrm{f}}-V_{\mathrm{i}} \approx V_{\mathrm{f}}=n R T / p_{\mathrm{ex}}$, where $n$ is the amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ produced. Therefore,

$$
w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \Delta V \approx-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \times \frac{n R T}{p_{\mathrm{ex}}}=-n R T
$$

Because the reaction is $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$, we know that $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2}$ is generated when 1 mol Fe is consumed, and $n$ can be taken as the amount of Fe atoms that react. Because the molar mass of Fe is $55.85 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, it follows that

The system (the reaction mixture) does 2.2 kJ of work driving back the atmosphere. Note that (for this perfect gas system) the magnitude of the external pressure does not affect the final result: the lower the pressure, the larger the volume occupied by the gas, so the effects cancel.

Answer: -10 kJ

## (c) Reversible expansion

A reversible change in thermodynamics is a change that can be reversed by an infinitesimal modification of a variable. The key word 'infinitesimal' sharpens the everyday meaning of the word 'reversible' as something that can change direction. One example of reversibility that we have encountered already is the thermal equilibrium of two systems with the same temperature. The transfer of energy as heat between the two is reversible because, if the temperature of either system is lowered infinitesimally, then energy flows into the system with the lower temperature. If the temperature of either system at thermal equilibrium is raised infinitesimally, then energy flows out of the hotter system. There is obviously a very close relationship between reversibility and equilibrium: systems at equilibrium are poised to undergo reversible change.

Suppose a gas is confined by a piston and that the external pressure, $p_{\mathrm{ex}}$, is set equal to the pressure, $p$, of the confined gas. Such a system is in mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings because an infinitesimal change in the external pressure in either direction causes changes in volume in opposite directions. If the external pressure is reduced infinitesimally, the gas expands slightly. If the external pressure is increased infinitesimally, the gas contracts slightly. In either case the change is reversible in the thermodynamic sense. If, on the other hand, the external pressure differs measurably from the internal pressure, then changing $p_{\mathrm{ex}}$ infinitesimally will not decrease it below the pressure of the gas, so will not change the direction of the process. Such a system is not in mechanical equilibrium
with its surroundings and the expansion is thermodynamically irreversible.

To achieve reversible expansion we set $p_{\text {ex }}$ equal to $p$ at each stage of the expansion. In practice, this equalization could be achieved by gradually removing weights from the piston so that the downward force due to the weights always matches the changing upward force due to the pressure of the gas. When we set $p_{\text {ex }}=p$, eqn 2A.5a becomes

$$
\mathrm{d} w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \mathrm{~d} V=-p \mathrm{~d} V \quad \text { Reversible expansion work }
$$

Although the pressure inside the system appears in this expression for the work, it does so only because $p_{\mathrm{ex}}$ has been set equal to $p$ to ensure reversibility. The total work of reversible expansion from an initial volume $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to a final volume $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ is therefore

$$
w=-\int_{V_{\mathrm{i}}}^{V_{\mathrm{f}}} p \mathrm{~d} V
$$

The integral can be evaluated once we know how the pressure of the confined gas depends on its volume. Equation 2A.8b is the link with the material covered in the Topics of Chapter 1 for, if we know the equation of state of the gas, then we can express $p$ in terms of $V$ and evaluate the integral.

## (d) Isothermal reversible expansion

Consider the isothermal, reversible expansion of a perfect gas. The expansion is made isothermal by keeping the system in thermal contact with its surroundings (which may be a constanttemperature bath). Because the equation of state is $p V=n R T$, we know that at each stage $p=n R T / V$, with $V$ the volume at that stage of the expansion. The temperature $T$ is constant in an isothermal expansion, so (together with $n$ and $R$ ) it may be taken outside the integral. It follows that the work of reversible isothermal expansion of a perfect gas from $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ at a temperature $T$ is

$$
w=-n R T \int_{V_{\mathrm{i}}}^{V_{\mathrm{f}}} \frac{\mathrm{~d} V}{V} \stackrel{\text { Integral A.2 }}{=}-n R T \ln \frac{V_{\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\mathrm{i}}}
$$

## Brief illustration 2A. 5 The work of isothermal reversible expansion

When a sample of 1.00 mol Ar , regarded here as a perfect gas, undergoes an isothermal reversible expansion at $20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ from $10.0 \mathrm{dm}^{3}$ to $30.0 \mathrm{dm}^{3}$ the work done is

$$
\begin{aligned}
w & =-(1.00 \mathrm{~mol}) \times\left(8.3145 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right) \times(293.2 \mathrm{~K}) \ln \frac{30.0 \mathrm{dm}^{3}}{10.0 \mathrm{dm}^{3}} \\
& =-2.68 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

Self-test 2A. 6 Suppose that attractions are important between gas molecules, and the equation of state is $p=n R T / V-n^{2} a / V^{2}$. Derive an expression for the reversible, isothermal expansion of this gas. Is more or less work done on the surroundings when it expands (compared with a perfect gas)?

Answer: $w=-n R T \ln \left(V_{\mathrm{f}} / V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)-n^{2} a\left(1 / V_{\mathrm{f}}-1 / V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$; less

When the final volume is greater than the initial volume, as in an expansion, the logarithm in eqn 2A. 9 is positive and hence $w<0$. In this case, the system has done work on the surroundings and there is a corresponding negative contribution to its internal energy. (Note the cautious language: we shall see later that there is a compensating influx of energy as heat, so overall the internal energy is constant for the isothermal expansion of a perfect gas.) The equations also show that more work is done for a given change of volume when the temperature is increased: at a higher temperature the greater pressure of the confined gas needs a higher opposing pressure to ensure reversibility and the work done is correspondingly greater.

We can express the result of the calculation as an indicator diagram, for the magnitude of the work done is equal to the area under the isotherm $p=n R T / V$ (Fig. 2A.7). Superimposed on the diagram is the rectangular area obtained for irreversible expansion against constant external pressure fixed at the same final value as that reached in the reversible expansion. More work is obtained when the expansion is reversible (the area is greater) because matching the external pressure to the internal pressure at each stage of the process ensures that none of the system's pushing power is wasted. We cannot obtain more work than for the reversible process because increasing the external pressure even infinitesimally at any stage results in compression. We may infer from this discussion that, because some pushing power is wasted when $p>p_{\text {ex }}$, the maximum work

Figure 2A. 7 The work done by a perfect gas when it expands reversibly and isothermally is equal to the area under the isotherm $p=n R T / V$. The work done during the irreversible expansion against the same final pressure is equal to the rectangular area shown slightly darker. Note that the reversible work is greater than the irreversible work.
available from a system operating between specified initial and final states and passing along a specified path is obtained when the change takes place reversibly.

We have introduced the connection between reversibility and maximum work for the special case of a perfect gas undergoing expansion. In Topic 3A we see that it applies to all substances and to all kinds of work.

## 2A. 4 Heat transactions

In general, the change in internal energy of a system is

$$
\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} q+\mathrm{d} w_{\exp }+\mathrm{d} w_{\mathrm{e}}
$$

where $\mathrm{d} w_{\mathrm{e}}$ is work in addition (e for 'extra') to the expansion work, $\mathrm{d} w_{\text {exp }}$. For instance, $\mathrm{d} w_{\mathrm{e}}$ might be the electrical work of driving a current through a circuit. A system kept at constant volume can do no expansion work, so $\mathrm{d} w_{\text {exp }}=0$. If the system is also incapable of doing any other kind of work (if it is not, for instance, an electrochemical cell connected to an electric motor), then $\mathrm{d} w_{\mathrm{e}}=0$ too. Under these circumstances:

$$
\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} q \quad \text { Heat transferred at constant volume }
$$

We express this relation by writing $\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} q_{V}$, where the subscript implies a change at constant volume. For a measurable change between states i and f along a path at constant volume,

$$
\overbrace{\int_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{f}}}^{U_{\mathrm{f}}-U_{\mathrm{i}}} d=\overbrace{\int_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{~d} q}^{q_{\mathrm{v}}}
$$

which we summarize as

$$
\Delta U=q_{V}
$$

Note that we do not write the integral over $\mathrm{d} q$ as $\Delta q$ because $q$, unlike $U$, is not a state function. It follows that, by measuring the energy supplied to a constant-volume system as heat $\left(q_{V}>0\right)$ or released from it as heat $\left(q_{V}<0\right)$ when it undergoes a change of state, we are in fact measuring the change in its internal energy.

## (a) Calorimetry

Calorimetry is the study of the transfer of energy as heat during physical and chemical processes. A calorimeter is a device for measuring energy transferred as heat. The most common device for measuring $q_{V}$ (and therefore $\Delta U$ ) is an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Fig. 2A.8). The process we wish to studywhich may be a chemical reaction-is initiated inside a con-stant-volume container, the 'bomb'. The bomb is immersed in

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-10.jpg?height=461&width=714&top_left_y=316&top_left_x=321)
Figure 2A. 8 A constant-volume bomb calorimeter. The 'bomb' is the central vessel, which is strong enough to withstand high pressures. The calorimeter (for which the heat capacity must be known) is the entire assembly shown here. To ensure adiabaticity, the calorimeter is immersed in a water bath with a temperature continuously readjusted to that of the calorimeter at each stage of the combustion.

a stirred water bath, and the whole device is the calorimeter. The calorimeter is also immersed in an outer water bath. The water in the calorimeter and of the outer bath are both monitored and adjusted to the same temperature. This arrangement ensures that there is no net loss of heat from the calorimeter to the surroundings (the bath) and hence that the calorimeter is adiabatic.

The change in temperature, $\Delta T$, of the calorimeter is proportional to the energy that the reaction releases or absorbs as heat. Therefore, by measuring $\Delta T$ we can determine $q_{V}$ and hence find $\Delta U$. The conversion of $\Delta T$ to $q_{V}$ is best achieved by calibrating the calorimeter using a process of known energy output and determining the calorimeter constant, the constant $C$ in the relation

$$
q=C \Delta T
$$

The calorimeter constant may be measured electrically by passing a constant current, $I$, from a source of known potential difference, $\Delta \phi$, through a heater for a known period of time, $t$, for then

$$
q=I t \Delta \phi
$$

Electrical charge is measured in coulombs, C. The motion of charge gives rise to an electric current, $I$, measured in coulombs per second, or amperes, A , where $1 \mathrm{~A}=1 \mathrm{C} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. If a constant current $I$ flows through a potential difference $\Delta \phi$ (measured in volts, V ), the total energy supplied in an interval $t$ is $I t \Delta \phi$. Because $1 \mathrm{AVs}=1\left(\mathrm{C} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\right) \mathrm{V} \mathrm{s}=1 \mathrm{C} \mathrm{V}=1 \mathrm{~J}$, the energy is obtained in joules with the current in amperes, the potential difference in volts, and the time in seconds.

## Brief illustration 2A. 6 Electrical heating

If a current of 10.0 A from a 12 V supply is passed for 300 s , then from eqn 2A. 13 the energy supplied as heat is

$$
q=(10.0 \mathrm{~A}) \times(12 \mathrm{~V}) \times(300 \mathrm{~s})=3.6 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{AVs}=36 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

because $1 \mathrm{AVs}=1 \mathrm{~J}$. If the observed rise in temperature is 5.5 K , then the calorimeter constant is $C=(36 \mathrm{~kJ}) /(5.5 \mathrm{~K})= 6.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$.

Self-test 2A.7 What is the value of the calorimeter constant if the temperature rises by $4.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when a current of 8.6 A from an 11 V supply is passed for 280 s ?

Answer: $5.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$

Alternatively, $C$ may be determined by burning a known mass of substance (benzoic acid is often used) that has a known heat output. With $C$ known, it is simple to interpret an observed temperature rise as a release of heat.

## (b) Heat capacity

The internal energy of a system increases when its temperature is raised. The increase depends on the conditions under which the heating takes place and for the present we suppose that the system has a constant volume. For example, it may be a gas in a container of fixed volume. If the internal energy is plotted against temperature, then a curve like that in Fig. 2A. 9 may be obtained. The slope of the tangent to the curve at any temperature is called the heat capacity of the system at that temperature. The heat capacity at constant volume is denoted $C_{V}$ and is defined formally as

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-10.jpg?height=487&width=791&top_left_y=1808&top_left_x=1207)
Figure 2A. 9 The internal energy of a system increases as the temperature is raised; this graph shows its variation as the system is heated at constant volume. The slope of the tangent to the curve at any temperature is the heat capacity at constant volume at that temperature. Note that, for the system illustrated, the heat capacity is greater at B than at A.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-11.jpg?height=491&width=627&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=405)
Figure 2A. 10 The internal energy of a system varies with volume and temperature, perhaps as shown here by the surface. The variation of the internal energy with temperature at one particular constant volume is illustrated by the curve drawn parallel to $T$. The slope of this curve at any point is the partial derivative $(\partial U / \partial T)_{V}$.

$$
C_{V}=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V} \quad \text { Definition } \quad \text { Heat capacity at constant volume }
$$

Partial derivatives are reviewed in Mathematical background 2 following this chapter. The internal energy varies with the temperature and the volume of the sample, but here we are interested only in its variation with the temperature, the volume being held constant (Fig. 2A.10).

## Brief illustration 2A. 7 Heat capacity

The heat capacity of a monatomic perfect gas can be calculated by inserting the expression for the internal energy derived in Briefillustration 2A. 2 where we saw that $U_{\mathrm{m}}(T)=U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)+\frac{3}{2} R T$, so from eqn 2A. 14

$$
C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left\{U_{\mathrm{m}}(0)+\frac{3}{2} R T\right\}=\frac{3}{2} R
$$

The numerical value is $12.47 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.
Self-test 2A.8 Estimate the molar constant-volume heat capacity of carbon dioxide.

$$
\text { Answer: } \frac{5}{2} R=21 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

Heat capacities are extensive properties: 100 g of water, for instance, has 100 times the heat capacity of 1 g of water (and therefore requires 100 times the energy as heat to bring about the same rise in temperature). The molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=C_{V} / n$, is the heat capacity per mole of substance, and is an intensive property (all molar quantities are intensive). Typical values of $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}$ for polyatomic gases are close to $25 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. For certain applications it is useful to know the specific heat capacity (more informally, the 'specific heat') of a
substance, which is the heat capacity of the sample divided by the mass, usually in grams: $C_{V, s}=C_{V} / m$. The specific heat capacity of water at room temperature is close to $4.2 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~g}^{-1}$. In general, heat capacities depend on the temperature and decrease at low temperatures. However, over small ranges of temperature at and above room temperature, the variation is quite small and for approximate calculations heat capacities can be treated as almost independent of temperature.

The heat capacity is used to relate a change in internal energy to a change in temperature of a constant-volume system. It follows from eqn 2A. 14 that

$$
\mathrm{d} U=C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

Constant volume (2A.15a)

That is, at constant volume, an infinitesimal change in temperature brings about an infinitesimal change in internal energy, and the constant of proportionality is $C_{V}$. If the heat capacity is independent of temperature over the range of temperatures of interest, then

$$
\Delta U=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T=C_{V} \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \mathrm{~d} T=C_{V} \overbrace{\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)}^{\Delta T}
$$

and a measurable change of temperature, $\Delta T$, brings about a measurable change in internal energy, $\Delta U$, where

$$
\Delta U=C_{V} \Delta T
$$

Constant volume
(2A.15b)
Because a change in internal energy can be identified with the heat supplied at constant volume (eqn 2A.11b), the last equation can also be written

$$
q_{V}=C_{V} \Delta T
$$

This relation provides a simple way of measuring the heat capacity of a sample: a measured quantity of energy is transferred as heat to the sample (electrically, for example), and the resulting increase in temperature is monitored. The ratio of the energy transferred as heat to the temperature rise it causes $\left(q_{V} / \Delta T\right)$ is the constant-volume heat capacity of the sample.

## Brief illustration 2A. 8 The determination of a heat capacity

Suppose a 55 W electric heater immersed in a gas in a con-stant-volume adiabatic container was on for 120 s and it was found that the temperature of the gas rose by $5.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (an increase equivalent to 5.0 K ). The heat supplied is $(55 \mathrm{~W}) \times(120 \mathrm{~s})=6.6 \mathrm{~kJ}$ (we have used $1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~s}$ ), so the heat capacity of the sample is

$$
C_{V}=\frac{6.6 \mathrm{~kJ}}{5.0 \mathrm{~K}}=1.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

Self-test 2A.9 When 229 J of energy is supplied as heat to 3.0 mol of a gas at constant volume, the temperature of the gas increases by $2.55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Calculate $C_{V}$ and the molar heat capacity at constant volume.

Answer: $89.8 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}, 29.9 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

A large heat capacity implies that, for a given quantity of energy transferred as heat, there will be only a small increase in temperature (the sample has a large capacity for heat). An
infinite heat capacity implies that there will be no increase in temperature however much energy is supplied as heat. At a phase transition, such as at the boiling point of water, the temperature of a substance does not rise as energy is supplied as heat: the energy is used to drive the endothermic transition, in this case to vaporize the water, rather than to increase its temperature. Therefore, at the temperature of a phase transition, the heat capacity of a sample is infinite. The properties of heat capacities close to phase transitions are treated more fully in Topic 4B.

Why do you need to know this material?
The concept of enthalpy is central to many thermodynamic discussions about processes taking place under conditions of constant pressure, such as the discussion of the heat requirements or output of physical transformations and chemical reactions.

What is the key idea?
A change in enthalpy is equal to the energy transferred as heat at constant pressure.

What do you need to know already?
This Topic makes use of the discussion of internal energy (Topic 2A) and draws on some aspects of perfect gases (Topic 1A).

The change in internal energy is not equal to the energy transferred as heat when the system is free to change its volume, such as when it is able to expand or contract under conditions of constant pressure. Under these circumstances some of the energy supplied as heat to the system is returned to the surroundings as expansion work (Fig. 2B.1), so $\mathrm{d} U$ is less than $\mathrm{d} q$. In this case the energy supplied as heat at constant pressure is equal to the change in another thermodynamic property of the system, the enthalpy.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-13.jpg?height=445&width=359&top_left_y=624&top_left_x=1462)
Figure 2B. 1 When a system is subjected to constant pressure and is free to change its volume, some of the energy supplied as heat may escape back into the surroundings as work. In such a case, the change in internal energy is smaller than the energy supplied as heat.

## 2B. 1 The definition of enthalpy

The enthalpy, $H$, is defined as

$$
H=U+p V
$$

Definition Enthalpy
where $p$ is the pressure of the system and $V$ is its volume. Because $U, p$ and $V$ are all state functions, the enthalpy is a state function too. As is true of any state function, the change in enthalpy, $\Delta H$, between any pair of initial and final states is independent of the path between them.

## (a) Enthalpy change and heat transfer

Although the definition of enthalpy may appear arbitrary, it has important implications for thermochemistry. For instance, we show in the following Justification that eqn 2B. 1 implies that the change in enthalpy is equal to the energy supplied as heat at constant pressure (provided the system does no additional work):

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\mathrm{d} q_{p} \quad \text { Heat transferred at constant pressure }
$$

For a measurable change between states i and f along a path at constant pressure, we write

$$
\overbrace{\int_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{~d} H}^{H_{\mathrm{f}}-H_{\mathrm{i}}}=\overbrace{\int_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{~d} q_{p}}^{q_{p}}
$$

and summarize the result as

$$
\Delta H=q_{p}
$$

Note that we do not write the integral over $\mathrm{d} q$ as $\Delta q$ because $q$, unlike $H$, is not a state function.

## Brief illustration 2B. 1 A change in enthalpy

Water is heated to boiling under a pressure of 1.0 atm . When an electric current of 0.50 A from a 12 V supply is passed for 300 s through a resistance in thermal contact with it, it is found that 0.798 g of water is vaporized. The enthalpy change is

$$
\Delta H=q_{p}=I t \Delta \phi=(0.50 \mathrm{~A}) \times(12 \mathrm{~V}) \times(300 \mathrm{~s})=(0.50 \times 12 \times 300) \mathrm{J}
$$

Here we have used $1 \mathrm{AVs}=1 \mathrm{~J}$. Because 0.798 g of water is $(0.798 \mathrm{~g}) /\left(18.02 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)=(0.798 / 18.02) \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the enthalpy of vaporization per mole of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{(0.50 \times 12 \times 300) \mathrm{J}}{(0.798 / 18.02) \mathrm{mol}}=+41 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

Self-test 2B. 1 The molar enthalpy of vaporization of benzene at its boiling point $(353.25 \mathrm{~K})$ is $30.8 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. For how long would the same 12 V source need to supply a 0.50 A current in order to vaporize a 10 g sample?

Answer: $6.6 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~s}$

## Justification 2B. 1 The relation $\Delta H=q_{p}$

For a general infinitesimal change in the state of the system, $U$ changes to $U+\mathrm{d} U, p$ changes to $p+\mathrm{d} p$, and $V$ changes to $V+\mathrm{d} V$, so from the definition in eqn 2B.1, $H$ changes from $U+p V$ to

$$
\begin{aligned}
H+\mathrm{d} H & =(U+\mathrm{d} U)+(p+\mathrm{d} p)(V+\mathrm{d} V) \\
& =U+\mathrm{d} U+p V+p \mathrm{~d} V+V \mathrm{~d} p+\mathrm{d} p \mathrm{~d} V
\end{aligned}
$$

The last term is the product of two infinitesimally small quantities and can therefore be neglected. As a result, after recognizing $U+p V=H$ on the right (in blue), we find that $H$ changes to

$$
H+\mathrm{d} H=H+\mathrm{d} U+p \mathrm{~d} V+V \mathrm{~d} p
$$

and hence that

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\mathrm{d} U+p \mathrm{~d} V+V \mathrm{~d} p
$$

If we now substitute $\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} q+\mathrm{d} w$ into this expression, we get

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\mathrm{d} q+\mathrm{d} w+p \mathrm{~d} V+V \mathrm{~d} p
$$

If the system is in mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings at a pressure $p$ and does only expansion work, we can write $\mathrm{d} w=-p \mathrm{~d} V$ and obtain

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\mathrm{d} q+V \mathrm{~d} p
$$

Now we impose the condition that the heating occurs at constant pressure by writing $\mathrm{d} p=0$. Then

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\mathrm{d} q \text { (at constant pressure, no additional work) }
$$

as in eqn 2B.2a. Equation 2B.2b then follows, as explained in the text.

## (b) Calorimetry

The process of measuring heat transactions between a system and its surroundings is called calorimetry. An enthalpy change can be measured calorimetrically by monitoring the temperature change that accompanies a physical or chemical change occurring at constant pressure. A calorimeter for studying processes at constant pressure is called an isobaric calorimeter. A simple example is a thermally insulated vessel open to the atmosphere: the heat released in the reaction is monitored by measuring the change in temperature of the contents. For a combustion reaction an adiabatic flame calorimeter may be used to measure $\Delta T$ when a given amount of substance burns in a supply of oxygen (Fig. 2B.2).

Another route to $\Delta H$ is to measure the internal energy change by using a bomb calorimeter, and then to convert $\Delta U$ to $\Delta H$. Because solids and liquids have small molar volumes, for them $p V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is so small that the molar enthalpy and molar internal energy are almost identical ( $H_{\mathrm{m}}=U_{\mathrm{m}}+p V_{\mathrm{m}} \approx U_{\mathrm{m}}$ ). Consequently, if a process involves only solids or liquids, the values of $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$ are almost identical. Physically, such processes are accompanied by a very small change in volume; the system does negligible work on the surroundings when the process occurs, so the energy supplied as heat stays entirely

within the system. The most sophisticated way to measure enthalpy changes, however, is to use a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), as explained in Topic 2C. Changes in enthalpy and internal energy may also be measured by non-calorimetric methods (see Topic 6C).

## Example 2B. 1 Relating $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$

The change in molar internal energy when $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$ as calcite converts to another form, aragonite, is $+0.21 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Calculate the difference between the molar enthalpy and internal energy changes when the pressure is 1.0 bar given that the densities of the polymorphs are $2.71 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ (calcite) and $2.93 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ (aragonite).

Method The starting point for the calculation is the relation between the enthalpy of a substance and its internal energy (eqn 2B.1). The difference between the two quantities can be expressed in terms of the pressure and the difference of their molar volumes, and the latter can be calculated from their molar masses, $M$, and their mass densities, $\rho$, by using $\rho=M / V_{\mathrm{m}}$.

Answer The change in enthalpy when the transition occurs is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}} & =H_{\mathrm{m}}(\text { aragonite })-H_{\mathrm{m}}(\text { calcite }) \\
& =\left\{U_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{a})+p V_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{a})\right\}-\left\{U_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{c})+p V_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{c})\right\} \\
& =\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}+p\left\{V_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{a})-V_{\mathrm{m}}(\mathrm{c})\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

where a denotes aragonite and c calcite. It follows by substituting $V_{\mathrm{m}}=M / \rho$ that

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}-\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}=p M\left(\frac{1}{\rho(\mathrm{a})}-\frac{1}{\rho(\mathrm{c})}\right)
$$

Substitution of the data, using $M=100.09 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}-\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}= & \left(1.0 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}\right) \times\left(100.09 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right) \\
& \times\left(\frac{1}{2.93 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}}-\frac{1}{2.71 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}}\right) \\
= & -2.8 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{Pacm}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=-0.28 \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence (because $\left.1 \mathrm{Pam}^{3}=1 \mathrm{~J}\right), \Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}-\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}=-0.28 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, which is only 0.1 per cent of the value of $\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}$. We see that it is usually justifiable to ignore the difference between the molar enthalpy and internal energy of condensed phases, except at very high pressures, when $p \Delta V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is no longer negligible.

Self-test 2B. 2 Calculate the difference between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$ when $1.0 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Sn}\left(\mathrm{s}\right.$, grey) of density $5.75 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ changes to $\mathrm{Sn}(\mathrm{s}$, white) of density $7.31 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ at 10.0 bar . At $298 \mathrm{~K}, \Delta H=+2.1 \mathrm{~kJ}$.

Answer: $\Delta H-\Delta U=-4.4 \mathrm{~J}$

In contrast to processes involving condensed phases, the values of the changes in internal energy and enthalpy may differ significantly for processes involving gases. Thus, the enthalpy of a perfect gas is related to its internal energy by using $p V=n R T$ in the definition of $H$ :

$$
H=U+p V=U+n R T
$$

This relation implies that the change of enthalpy in a reaction that produces or consumes gas under isothermal conditions is

$$
\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{\mathrm{g}} R T \quad \begin{array}{ll}
\text { Perfect gas, } & \text { Relation } \\
\text { isothermal } & \text { between } \Delta H \\
\text { and } \Delta U
\end{array}
$$

where $\Delta n_{\mathrm{g}}$ is the change in the amount of gas molecules in the reaction.

## Brief illustration 2B.2 Processes involving gases

In the reaction $2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}), 3 \mathrm{~mol}$ of gas-phase molecules are replaced by 2 mol of liquid-phase molecules, so $\Delta n_{\mathrm{g}}=-3 \mathrm{~mol}$. Therefore, at 298 K , when $R T=2.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, the enthalpy and internal energy changes taking place in the system are related by

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}-\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}=(-3 \mathrm{~mol}) \times R T \approx-7.4 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

Note that the difference is expressed in kilojoules, not joules as in Example 2B.2. The enthalpy change is smaller (in this case, less negative) than the change in internal energy because, although heat escapes from the system when the reaction occurs, the system contracts when the liquid is formed, so energy is restored to it from the surroundings.

Self-test 2B. 3 Calculate the value of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}-\Delta U_{\mathrm{m}}$ for the reaction $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})$.

Answer: $-5.0 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

## 2B.2 The variation of enthalpy with temperature

The enthalpy of a substance increases as its temperature is raised. The relation between the increase in enthalpy and the increase in temperature depends on the conditions (for example, constant pressure or constant volume).

## (a) Heat capacity at constant pressure

The most important condition is constant pressure, and the slope of the tangent to a plot of enthalpy against temperature at constant pressure is called the heat capacity at constant

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-16.jpg?height=498&width=803&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=277)
Figure 2B. 3 The constant-pressure heat capacity at a particular temperature is the slope of the tangent to a curve of the enthalpy of a system plotted against temperature (at constant pressure). For gases, at a given temperature the slope of enthalpy versus temperature is steeper than that of internal energy versus temperature, and $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}$ is larger than $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}$.

pressure (or isobaric heat capacity), $C_{p}$, at a given temperature (Fig. 2B.3). More formally:

$$
C_{p}=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_{p} \text { Definition Heat capacity at constant pressure }
$$

The heat capacity at constant pressure is the analogue of the heat capacity at constant volume (Topic 1A) and is an extensive property. The molar heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}$, is the heat capacity per mole of substance; it is an intensive property.

The heat capacity at constant pressure is used to relate the change in enthalpy to a change in temperature. For infinitesimal changes of temperature,

$$
\mathrm{d} H=C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T \quad \text { (at constant pressure) }
$$

If the heat capacity is constant over the range of temperatures of interest, then for a measurable increase in temperature

$$
\Delta H=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T=C_{p} \int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \mathrm{~d} T=C_{p} \overbrace{\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)}^{\Delta T}
$$

which we can summarize as

$$
\Delta H=C_{p} \Delta T \quad \text { (at constant pressure) }
$$

Because a change in enthalpy can be equated with the energy supplied as heat at constant pressure, the practical form of the latter equation is

$$
q_{p}=C_{p} \Delta T
$$

Table 2B.1* Temperature variation of molar heat capacities, $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}} /\left(\mathrm{J} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)=a+b T+c / T^{2}$

| $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | 28.58 | 3.77 | -0.50 |


* More values are given in the Resource section.

This expression shows us how to measure the heat capacity of a sample: a measured quantity of energy is supplied as heat under conditions of constant pressure (as in a sample exposed to the atmosphere and free to expand), and the temperature rise is monitored.

The variation of heat capacity with temperature can sometimes be ignored if the temperature range is small; this approximation is highly accurate for a monatomic perfect gas (for instance, one of the noble gases at low pressure). However, when it is necessary to take the variation into account, a convenient approximate empirical expression is

$$
C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=a+b T+\frac{c}{T^{2}}
$$

The empirical parameters $a, b$, and $c$ are independent of temperature (Table 2B.1) and are found by fitting this expression to experimental data.

## Example 2B. 2 Evaluating an increase in enthalpy with temperature

What is the change in molar enthalpy of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ when it is heated from $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ? Use the heat capacity information in Table 2B.1.

Method The heat capacity of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ changes with temperature, so we cannot use eqn 2B. 6 b (which assumes that the heat capacity of the substance is constant). Therefore, we must use eqn 2B.6a, substitute eqn 2B. 8 for the temperature dependence of the heat capacity, and integrate the resulting expression from $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$ to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(373 \mathrm{~K})$.

Answer For convenience, we denote the two temperatures $T_{1} (298 \mathrm{~K})$ and $T_{2}(373 \mathrm{~K})$. The relation we require is

$$
\int_{H_{\mathrm{m}}\left(T_{1}\right)}^{H_{\mathrm{m}}\left(T_{2}\right)} \mathrm{d} H_{\mathrm{m}}=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}\left(a+b T+\frac{c}{T^{2}}\right) \mathrm{d} T
$$

After using Integral A. 1 in the Resource section, it follows that

$$
H_{\mathrm{m}}\left(T_{2}\right)-H_{\mathrm{m}}\left(T_{1}\right)=a\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)+\frac{1}{2} b\left(T_{2}^{2}-T_{1}^{2}\right)-c\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)
$$

Substitution of the numerical data results in

$$
H_{\mathrm{m}}(373 \mathrm{~K})=H_{\mathrm{m}}(298 \mathrm{~K})+2.20 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

If we had assumed a constant heat capacity of $29.14 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ (the value given by eqn 2B. 8 for $T=298 \mathrm{~K}$ ), we would have found that the two enthalpies differed by $2.19 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.

Self-test 2B.4 At very low temperatures the heat capacity of a solid is proportional to $T^{3}$, and we can write $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=a T^{3}$. What is the change in enthalpy of such a substance when it is heated from 0 to a temperature $T$ (with $T$ close to 0 )?

Answer: $\Delta H_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{1}{4} a T^{4}$

## (b) The relation between heat capacities

Most systems expand when heated at constant pressure. Such systems do work on the surroundings and therefore some of the
energy supplied to them as heat escapes back to the surroundings. As a result, the temperature of the system rises less than when the heating occurs at constant volume. A smaller increase in temperature implies a larger heat capacity, so we conclude that in most cases the heat capacity at constant pressure of a system is larger than its heat capacity at constant volume. We show in Topic 2D that there is a simple relation between the two heat capacities of a perfect gas:

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=n R
$$

It follows that the molar heat capacity of a perfect gas is about $8 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ larger at constant pressure than at constant volume. Because the molar constant-volume heat capacity of a monatomic gas is about $\frac{3}{2} R=12 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, the difference is highly significant and must be taken into account.

## Why do you need to know this material?

Thermochemistry is one of the principal applications of thermodynamics in chemistry, for thermochemical data provide a way of assessing the heat output of chemical reactions, including those involved in the consumption of fuels and foods. The data are also used widely in other chemical applications of thermodynamics.

## What is the key idea?

Reaction enthalpies can be combined to provide data on other reactions of interest.

## - What do you need to know already?

You need to be aware of the definition of enthalpy and its status as a state function (Topic 2B). The material on temperature dependence of reaction enthalpies makes use of information on heat capacity (Topic 2B).

The study of the energy transferred as heat during the course of chemical reactions is called thermochemistry. Thermochemistry is a branch of thermodynamics because a reaction vessel and its contents form a system, and chemical reactions result in the exchange of energy between the system and the surroundings. Thus we can use calorimetry to measure the energy supplied or discarded as heat by a reaction, and can identify $q$ with a change in internal energy if the reaction occurs at constant volume or with a change in enthalpy if the reaction occurs at constant pressure. Conversely, if we know $\Delta U$ or $\Delta H$ for a reaction, we can predict the heat the reaction can produce.

As pointed out in Topic 2A, a process that releases energy as heat into the surroundings is classified as exothermic and one that absorbs energy as heat from the surroundings is classified as endothermic. Because the release of heat at constant pressure signifies a decrease in the enthalpy of a system, it follows that an exothermic process is one for which $\Delta H<0$. Conversely, because the absorption of heat results in an increase in enthalpy, an endothermic process has $\Delta H>0$ :
exothermic process: $\Delta H<0$ endothermic process: $\Delta H>0$

## 2C.1 Standard enthalpy changes

Changes in enthalpy are normally reported for processes taking place under a set of standard conditions. In most of our discussions we shall consider the standard enthalpy change, $\Delta H^{\ominus}$, the change in enthalpy for a process in which the initial and final substances are in their standard states:

The standard state of a substance at a specified temperature is its pure form at 1 bar.
Specification of standard state
Specification of standard

For example, the standard state of liquid ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at 298 K and 1 bar; the standard state of solid iron at 500 K is pure iron at 500 K and 1 bar. The definition of standard state is more sophisticated for solutions (Topic 5E). The standard enthalpy change for a reaction or a physical process is the difference between the products in their standard states and the reactants in their standard states, all at the same specified temperature.

As an example of a standard enthalpy change, the standard enthalpy of vaporization, $\Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus}$, is the enthalpy change per mole of molecules when a pure liquid at 1 bar vaporizes to a gas at 1 bar, as in

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus}(373 \mathrm{~K})=+40.66 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

As implied by the examples, standard enthalpies may be reported for any temperature. However, the conventional temperature for reporting thermodynamic data is 298.15 K . Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated by attaching the temperature to $\Delta H^{\ominus}$, all thermodynamic data in this text are for this conventional temperature.

A note on good practice The attachment of the name of the transition to the symbol $\Delta$, as in $\Delta_{\text {vap }} H$, is the current convention. However, the older convention, $\Delta H_{\text {vap }}$, is still widely used. The current convention is more logical because the subscript identifies the type of change, not the physical observable related to the change.

## (a) Enthalpies of physical change

The standard enthalpy change that accompanies a change of physical state is called the standard enthalpy of transition and is denoted $\Delta_{\mathrm{trs}} H^{\ominus}$ (Table 2C.1). The standard enthalpy of vaporization, $\Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus}$, is one example. Another is the standard enthalpy of fusion, $\Delta_{\text {fus }} H^{\ominus}$, the standard enthalpy change accompanying the conversion of a solid to a liquid, as in

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \quad \Delta_{\text {fus }} H^{\ominus}(273 \mathrm{~K})=+6.01 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
$$

| Activation | Reactants → activated complex | $\Delta^{\ddagger} H$ |


* IUPAC recommendations. In common usage, the transition subscript is often attached to $\Delta H$, as in $\Delta H_{\text {trs }}$.

As in this case, it is sometimes convenient to know the standard enthalpy change at the transition temperature as well as at the conventional temperature of 298 K . The different types of enthalpies encountered in thermochemistry are summarized in Table 2C.2. We meet them again in various locations throughout the text.

Because enthalpy is a state function, a change in enthalpy is independent of the path between the two states. This feature is of great importance in thermochemistry, for it implies that the same value of $\Delta H^{\ominus}$ will be obtained however the change is brought about between the same initial and final states. For example, we can picture the conversion of a solid to a vapour either as occurring by sublimation (the direct conversion from solid to vapour),

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta_{\mathrm{sub}} H^{\ominus}
$$

or as occurring in two steps, first fusion (melting) and then vaporization of the resulting liquid:

$$
\begin{array}{lll} 
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) & \Delta_{\text {fus }} H^{\ominus} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus} \\
\text { Overall: } & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta_{\text {fus }} H^{\ominus}+\Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus}
\end{array}
$$

Because the overall result of the indirect path is the same as that of the direct path, the overall enthalpy change is the same in each case (1), and we can conclude that (for processes occurring at the same temperature)

$$
\Delta_{\text {sub }} H^{\ominus}=\Delta_{\text {fus }} H^{\ominus}+\Delta_{\text {vap }} H^{\ominus}
$$

An immediate conclusion is that, because all enthalpies of fusion are positive, the enthalpy of sublimation of a substance is greater than its enthalpy of vaporization (at a given temperature).

Another consequence of $H$ being a state function is that the standard enthalpy changes of a forward process and its reverse differ in sign (2):

$$
\Delta H^{\ominus}(\mathrm{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{~B})=-\Delta H^{\ominus}(\mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{~A})
$$

For instance, because the enthalpy of vaporization of water is $+44 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at 298 K , its enthalpy of condensation at that temperature is $-44 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-20.jpg?height=256&width=425&top_left_y=1323&top_left_x=464)

The vaporization of a solid often involves a large increase in energy, especially when the solid is ionic and the strong Coulombic interaction of the ions must be overcome in a process such as

$$
\mathrm{MX}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{M}^{+}(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{X}^{-}(\mathrm{g})
$$

The lattice enthalpy, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{L}}$, is the change in standard molar enthalpy for this process. The lattice enthalpy is equal to the lattice internal energy at $T=0$; at normal temperatures they differ by only a few kilojoules per mole, and the difference is normally neglected.

Experimental values of the lattice enthalpy are obtained by using a Born-Haber cycle, a closed path of transformations starting and ending at the same point, one step of which is the formation of the solid compound from a gas of widely separated ions.

## Brief illustration 2C. 1 A Born-Haber cycle

A typical Born-Haber cycle, for potassium chloride, is shown in Fig. 2C.1.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-20.jpg?height=463&width=771&top_left_y=337&top_left_x=1221)
Figure 2C. 1 The Born-Haber cycle for KCl at 298 K . Enthalpy changes are in kilojoules per mole.

It consists of the following steps (for convenience, starting at the elements):

| $\Delta H^{\ominus} /\left(\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\right)$ |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Sublimation of K(s) | +89 | [dissociation enthalpy of K(s)] |
| 2. Dissociation of $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | +122 | [ $\frac{1}{2} \times$ dissociation enthalpy of $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ ] |
| 3. Ionization of $\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{g})$ | +418 | [ionization enthalpy of $\mathrm{K}(\mathrm{g})$ ] |
| 4. Electron attachment to $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})$ | -349 | [electron gain enthalpy of $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})$ ] |
| 5. Formation of solid from gas | $-\Delta H_{\mathrm{L}} /\left(\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\right)$ |  |
| 6. Decomposition of compound | +437 | [negative of enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{s})$ ] |

Because the sum of these enthalpy changes is equal to zero, we can infer from

$$

Self-test 2C. 1 Assemble a similar cycle for the lattice enthalpy of magnesium chloride.

Answer: $2523 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

Lattice enthalpies obtained in the same way as in Briefillustration 2C. 1 are listed in Table 2C.3. They are large when the ions are highly charged and small, for then they are close together and attract each other strongly. We examine the quantitative relation between lattice enthalpy and structure in Topic 18B.

## (b) Enthalpies of chemical change

Now we consider enthalpy changes that accompany chemical reactions. There are two ways of reporting the change in enthalpy that accompanies a chemical reaction. One is to write

Table 2C.3* Lattice enthalpies at $298 \mathrm{~K}, \Delta H_{\mathrm{L}} /\left(\mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\right)$
| NaF | 787 |
| :--- | :--- |
| NaBr | 751 |
| MgO | 3850 |
| MgS | 3406 |


* More values are given in the Resource section.
the thermochemical equation, a combination of a chemical equation and the corresponding change in standard enthalpy:

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H^{\ominus}=-890 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

$\Delta H^{\ominus}$ is the change in enthalpy when reactants in their standard states change to products in their standard states:

Pure, separate reactants in their standard states
→ pure, separate products in their standard states
Except in the case of ionic reactions in solution, the enthalpy changes accompanying mixing and separation are insignificant in comparison with the contribution from the reaction itself. For the combustion of methane, the standard value refers to the reaction in which $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CH}_{4}$ in the form of pure methane gas at 1 bar reacts completely with $2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the form of pure oxygen gas to produce $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as pure carbon dioxide at 1 bar and $2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ as pure liquid water at 1 bar; the numerical value is for the reaction at 298.15 K .

Alternatively, we write the chemical equation and then report the standard reaction enthalpy, $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$ (or 'standard enthalpy of reaction'). Thus, for the combustion of methane, we write

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \\
& \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}=-890 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

For a reaction of the form $2 \mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{B} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D}$ the standard reaction enthalpy would be

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}=\left\{3 H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{C})+H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{D})\right\}-\left\{2 H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{A})+H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{B})\right\}
$$

where $H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{J})$ is the standard molar enthalpy of species J at the temperature of interest. Note how the 'per mole' of $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$ comes directly from the fact that molar enthalpies appear in this expression. We interpret the 'per mole' by noting the stoichiometric coefficients in the chemical equation. In this case, 'per mole' in $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$ means 'per 2 mol A', 'per mole B ', 'per 3 mol C ', or ‘per mol D’. In general,

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}=\sum_{\text {Products }} \nu H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus}-\sum_{\text {Reactants }} \nu H_{\mathrm{m}}^{\ominus} \text { Definition } \begin{aligned}
& \text { Standard } \\
& \text { reaction } \\
& \text { enthalpy }
\end{aligned}
$$

where in each case the molar enthalpies of the species are multiplied by their (dimensionless and positive) stoichiometric coefficients, $\nu$. This formal definition is of little practical value
because the absolute values of the standard molar enthalpies are unknown: we see in Section 2C.2a how that problem is overcome.

Some standard reaction enthalpies have special names and a particular significance. For instance, the standard enthalpy of combustion, $\Delta_{\mathrm{c}} H^{\ominus}$, is the standard reaction enthalpy for the complete oxidation of an organic compound to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas and liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ if the compound contains $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{H}$, and O , and to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ gas if N is also present.

## Brief illustration 2C. 2 Enthalpy of combustion

The combustion of glucose is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}(\mathrm{~s})+6 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 6 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \\
\Delta_{\mathrm{c}} H^{\ominus}=-2808 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{gathered}
$$

The value quoted shows that 2808 kJ of heat is released when $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}$ burns under standard conditions (at 298 K ). More values are given in Table 2C.4.

## (c) Hess's law

Standard enthalpies of individual reactions can be combined to obtain the enthalpy of another reaction. This application of the First Law is called Hess's law:

The standard enthalpy of an overall reaction is the sum of the standard enthalpies of the individual reactions into which a reaction may be divided.

The individual steps need not be realizable in practice: they may be hypothetical reactions, the only requirement being that their chemical equations should balance. The thermodynamic basis of the law is the path-independence of the value of $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$ and the implication that we may take the specified reactants, pass through any (possibly hypothetical) set of reactions to the specified products, and overall obtain the same change of enthalpy. The importance of Hess's law is that
information about a reaction of interest, which may be difficult to determine directly, can be assembled from information on other reactions.

## Example 2C. 1 Using Hess's law

The standard reaction enthalpy for the hydrogenation of propene,

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CHCH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

is $-124 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. The standard reaction enthalpy for the combustion of propane,

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+5 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})
$$

is $-2220 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. The standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of water,

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})
$$

is $-286 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Calculate the standard enthalpy of combustion of propene.

Method The skill to develop is the ability to assemble a given thermochemical equation from others. Add or subtract the reactions given, together with any others needed, so as to reproduce the reaction required. Then add or subtract the reaction enthalpies in the same way.

Answer The combustion reaction we require is

$$
\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{6}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{9}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})
$$

## 2C.2 Standard enthalpies of formation

The standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}$, of a substance is the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of the compound from its elements in their reference states:

The reference state of an element is its most stable state at the specified temperature and 1 bar.
Specification of reference state

For example, at 298 K the reference state of nitrogen is a gas of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecules, that of mercury is liquid mercury, that of carbon is graphite, and that of tin is the white (metallic) form. There is one exception to this general prescription of reference states: the reference state of phosphorus is taken to be white phosphorus despite this allotrope not being the most stable form but simply the more reproducible form of the element. Standard enthalpies of formation are expressed as enthalpies per mole of molecules or (for ionic substances) formula units of the compound. The standard enthalpy of formation of liquid benzene at 298 K , for example, refers to the reaction

$$
6 \mathrm{C}(\text { s, graphite })+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}(\mathrm{l})
$$

and is $+49.0 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. The standard enthalpies of formation of elements in their reference states are zero at all temperatures because they are the enthalpies of such 'null' reactions as $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$. Some enthalpies of formation are listed in Tables 2C. 5 and 2C.6.

The standard enthalpy of formation of ions in solution poses a special problem because it is impossible to prepare a solution of cations alone or of anions alone. This problem is solved by

## Brief illustration 2C. 3 Enthalpies of formation of ions in solution

If the enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{aq})$ is found to be -122 kJ $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, then the whole of that value is ascribed to the formation of $\mathrm{Br}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})$, and we write $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Br}^{-}, \mathrm{aq}\right)=-122 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. That value may then be combined with, for instance, the enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{AgBr}(\mathrm{aq})$ to determine the value of $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \mathrm{aq}\right)$, and so on. In essence, this definition adjusts the actual values of the enthalpies of formation of ions by a fixed amount, which is chosen so that the standard value for one of them, $\mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})$, has the value zero.

Self-test 2C. 4 Determine the value of $\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \mathrm{aq}\right)$; the standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{AgBr}(\mathrm{aq})$ is $-17 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.

Answer: $+105 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

## (a) The reaction enthalpy in terms of enthalpies of formation

Conceptually, we can regard a reaction as proceeding by decomposing the reactants into their elements and then forming those elements into the products. The value of $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$ for the overall reaction is the sum of these 'unforming' and forming enthalpies. Because 'unforming' is the reverse of forming, the enthalpy of an unforming step is the negative of the enthalpy of formation (3).

Hence, in the enthalpies of formation of substances, we have enough information to calculate the enthalpy of any reaction by using

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}= & \sum_{\text {Products }} v \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus} \\
& -\sum_{\text {Reactants }} v \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}
\end{aligned}
$$

Practical implementation

> Standard reaction enthalpy

(2C.5a)
where in each case the enthalpies of formation of the species that occur are multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients. This procedure is the practical implementation of the formal definition in eqn 2C.3. A more sophisticated way of expressing
the same result is to introduce the stoichiometric numbers $\nu_{\mathrm{J}}$ (as distinct from the stoichiometric coefficients), which are positive for products and negative for reactants. Then we can write

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}=\sum_{\mathrm{J}} v_{\mathrm{J}} \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}(\mathrm{J})
$$

Stoichiometric numbers, which have a sign, are denoted $\nu_{\mathrm{J}}$ or $\nu(\mathrm{J})$. Stoichiometric coefficients, which are all positive, are denoted simply $\nu$ (with no subscript).

## Brief illustration 2C. 4 Enthalpies of formation

According to eqn 2C.5a, the standard enthalpy of the reaction $2 \mathrm{HN}_{3}(\mathrm{l})+2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{l})+4 \mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ is calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}= & \left\{\Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{l}\right)+4 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{~g}\right)\right\} \\
& -\left\{2 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{HN}_{3}, \mathrm{l}\right)+2 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}(\mathrm{NO}, \mathrm{~g})\right\} \\
= & \{-187.78+4(0)\} \mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}-\{2(264.0) \\
& +2(90.25)\} \mathrm{kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\
= & -896.3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

To use eqn 2C.5b, we identify $\nu\left(\mathrm{HN}_{3}\right)=-2, \nu(\mathrm{NO})=-2$, $\nu\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)=+1$, and $\nu\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)=+4$, and then write

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}= & \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{l}\right)+4 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{~g}\right)-2 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{HN}_{3}, \mathrm{l}\right) \\
& \left.-2 \Delta_{\mathrm{f}} H^{\ominus}(\mathrm{NO}, \mathrm{~g})\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

which gives the same result.

Answer: $+131.29 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

## (b) Enthalpies of formation and molecular modelling

We have seen how to construct standard reaction enthalpies by combining standard enthalpies of formation. The question that now arises is whether we can construct standard enthalpies of formation from a knowledge of the chemical constitution of the species. The short answer is that there is no thermodynamically exact way of expressing enthalpies of formation in terms of contributions from individual atoms and bonds. In the past, approximate procedures based on mean bond enthalpies, $\Delta H(\mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{B})$, the average enthalpy change associated with the breaking of a specific $\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}$ bond,

$$
\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{A}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H(\mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{B})
$$

have been used. However, this procedure is notoriously unreliable, in part because the $\Delta H(\mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{B})$ are average values for a
series of related compounds. Nor does the approach distinguish between geometrical isomers, where the same atoms and bonds may be present but experimentally the enthalpies of formation might be significantly different.

Computer-aided molecular modelling has largely displaced this more primitive approach. Commercial software packages use the principles developed in Topic 10E to calculate the standard enthalpy of formation of a molecule drawn on the computer screen. These techniques can be applied to different conformations of the same molecule. In the case of methylcyclohexane, for instance, the calculated conformational energy difference ranges from 5.9 to $7.9 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, with the equatorial conformer having the lower standard enthalpy of formation. These estimates compare favourably with the experimental value of $7.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. However, good agreement between calculated and experimental values is relatively rare. Computational methods almost always predict correctly which conformer is more stable but do not always predict the correct magnitude of the conformational energy difference. The most reliable technique for the determination of enthalpies of formation remains calorimetry, typically by using enthalpies of combustion.

## Brief illustration 2C. 5

Molecular modelling
Each software package has its own procedures; the general approach, though, is the same in most cases: the structure of the molecule is specified and the nature of the calculation selected. When the procedure is applied to the axial and equatorial isomers of methylcyclohexane, a typical value for the standard enthalpy of formation of equatorial isomer in the gas phase is $-183 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ (using the AM1 semi-empirical procedure) whereas that for the axial isomer is $-177 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, a difference of $6 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. The experimental difference is 7.5 kJ $\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.

Self-test 2C. 6 If you have access to modelling software, repeat this calculation for the two isomers of cyclohexanol.

Answer: Using AM1: eq: $-345 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$; ax: $-349 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

## 2C.3 The temperature dependence of reaction enthalpies

The standard enthalpies of many important reactions have been measured at different temperatures. However, in the absence of this information, standard reaction enthalpies at different temperatures may be calculated from heat capacities and the reaction enthalpy at some other temperature (Fig. 2C.2). In many cases heat capacity data are more accurate than reaction enthalpies. Therefore, providing the information is available, the procedure we are about to describe is more accurate than the direct measurement of a reaction enthalpy at an elevated temperature.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-24.jpg?height=491&width=798&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=1205)
Figure 2C. 2 When the temperature is increased, the enthalpy of the products and the reactants both increase, but may do so to different extents. In each case, the change in enthalpy depends on the heat capacities of the substances. The change in reaction enthalpy reflects the difference in the changes of the enthalpies.

It follows from eqn 2B.6a ( $\mathrm{d} H=C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T$ ) that, when a substance is heated from $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$, its enthalpy changes from $H\left(T_{1}\right)$ to

$$
H\left(T_{2}\right)=H\left(T_{2}\right)+\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

(We have assumed that no phase transition takes place in the temperature range of interest.) Because this equation applies to each substance in the reaction, the standard reaction enthalpy changes from $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}\left(T_{1}\right)$ to

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}\left(T_{2}\right)=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}\left(T_{2}\right)+\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus} \mathrm{d} T \quad \text { Kirchhoff's law }
$$

where $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}$ is the difference of the molar heat capacities of products and reactants under standard conditions weighted by the stoichiometric coefficients that appear in the chemical equation:

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}=\sum_{\text {Products }} \nu C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}-\sum_{\text {Reactants }} \nu C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}
$$

or, in the notation of eqn 2C.5b,

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}=\sum_{\mathrm{J}} \nu_{\mathrm{J}} C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}(\mathrm{J})
$$

Equation 2C.7a is known as Kirchhoff's law. It is normally a good approximation to assume that $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}$ is independent of the temperature, at least over reasonably limited ranges. Although the individual heat capacities may vary, their difference varies less significantly. In some cases the temperature dependence of heat capacities is taken into account by using eqn 2B.8.

## Example 2C. 2 Using Kirchhoff's law

The standard enthalpy of formation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$ at 298 K is $-241.82 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Estimate its value at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ given the following values of the molar heat capacities at constant pressure: $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}): 33.58 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} ; \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}): 28.84 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} ; \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ : $29.37 \mathrm{~J}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Assume that the heat capacities are independent of temperature.

Method When $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}$ is independent of temperature in the range $T_{1}$ to $T_{2}$, the integral in eqn 2C.7a evaluates to $\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right) \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}$. Therefore,

$$
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}\left(T_{2}\right)=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}\left(T_{1}\right)+\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right) \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}
$$

To proceed, write the chemical equation, identify the stoichiometric coefficients, and calculate $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus}$ from the data.

Answer The reaction is $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} C_{p}^{\ominus} & =C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{~g}\right)-\left\{C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{~g}\right)+\frac{1}{2} C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}^{\ominus}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{~g}\right)\right\} \\
& =-9.94 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

It then follows that

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}(373 \mathrm{~K})= & -241.82 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}+(75 \mathrm{~K}) \\
& \times\left(-9.94 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)=-242.6 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Answer: $-163 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$

## 2C.4 Experimental techniques

The classic tool of thermochemistry is the calorimeter, as summarized in Topic 2B. However, technological advances have been made that allow measurements to be made on samples with mass as little as a few milligrams. We describe two of them here.

## (a) Differential scanning calorimetry

A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) measures the energy transferred as heat to or from a sample at constant pressure during a physical or chemical change. The term 'differential' refers to the fact that the behaviour of the sample is compared to that of a reference material that does not undergo a physical or chemical change during the analysis. The term 'scanning' refers to the fact that the temperatures of the sample and reference material are increased, or scanned, during the analysis.

A DSC consists of two small compartments that are heated electrically at a constant rate. The temperature, $T$, at time $t$ during a linear scan is $T=T_{0}+\alpha t$, where $T_{0}$ is the initial temperature

and $\alpha$ is the scan rate. A computer controls the electrical power supply that maintains the same temperature in the sample and reference compartments throughout the analysis (Fig. 2C.3).

If no physical or chemical change occurs in the sample at temperature $T$, we write the heat transferred to the sample as $q_{p}=C_{p} \Delta T$, where $\Delta T=T-T_{0}$ and we have assumed that $C_{p}$ is independent of temperature. Because $T=T_{0}+\alpha t, \Delta T=\alpha t$. The chemical or physical process requires the transfer of $q_{p}+q_{p, \text { ex }}$, where $q_{p, \text { ex }}$ is the excess energy transferred as heat needed to attain the same change in temperature of the sample as the control. The quantity $q_{p, \text { ex }}$ is interpreted in terms of an apparent change in the heat capacity at constant pressure of the sample, $C_{p}$, during the temperature scan:

$$
C_{p, \mathrm{ex}}=\frac{q_{p, \mathrm{ex}}}{\Delta T}=\frac{q_{p, \mathrm{ex}}}{\alpha t}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{ex}}}{\alpha}
$$

where $P_{\mathrm{ex}}=q_{p, \mathrm{ex}} / t$ is the excess electrical power necessary to equalize the temperature of the sample and reference compartments. A DSC trace, also called a thermogram, consists of a plot of $C_{p, \text { ex }}$ against $T$ (Fig. 2C.4). The enthalpy change associated with the process is

$$
\Delta H=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} C_{p, \mathrm{ex}} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

where $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are, respectively, the temperatures at which the process begins and ends. This relation shows that the enthalpy change is equal to the area under the plot of $C_{p, \text { ex }}$ against $T$.

The technique is used, for instance, to assess the stability of proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. The thermogram shown in Fig. 2C. 4 indicates that the protein ubiquitin undergoes an endothermic conformational change in which a large number of non-covalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) are broken simultaneously and result in denaturation, the loss of the protein's three-dimensional structure. The area under the curve represents the heat absorbed in this process and

can be identified with the enthalpy change. The thermogram also reveals the formation of new intermolecular interactions in the denatured form. The increase in heat capacity accompanying the native → denatured transition reflects the change from a more compact native conformation to one in which the more exposed amino acid side chains in the denatured form have more extensive interactions with the surrounding water molecules.

## (b) Isothermal titration calorimetry

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is also a 'differential' technique in which the thermal behaviour of a sample is compared with that of a reference. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 2C.5. One of the thermally conducting vessels, which have a volume of a few millilitres ( $10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ ), contains the reference (water for instance) and a heater rated at a few milliwatts. The second vessel contains one of the reagents, such as a solution of a macromolecule with binding sites; it also contains a heater. At the start of the experiment, both heaters are activated, and then precisely determined amounts (of volume of about a microlitre, $\left.10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}^{3}\right)$ of the second reagent are added to the reaction cell. The power required to maintain the same temperature differential with the reference cell is monitored. If the reaction is exothermic, less power is needed; if it is endothermic, then more power must be supplied.

Figure 2C. 6 (a) The record of the power applied as each injection is made, and (b) the sum of successive enthalpy changes in the course of the titration.

A typical result is shown in Fig. 2C.6, which shows the power needed to maintain the temperature differential: from the power and the length of time, $\delta t$, for which it is supplied, the heat supplied, $\delta q_{i}$, for the injection $i$ can be calculated from $\delta q_{i}=P_{i} \delta t$. If the volume of solution is $V$ and the molar concentration of unreacted reagent A is $c_{i}$ at the time of the $i$ th injection, then the change in its concentration at that injection is $\delta c_{i}$ and the heat generated (or absorbed) by the reaction is $V \Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H \delta c_{i}=\delta q_{i}$. The sum of all such quantities, given that the sum of $\delta c_{i}$ is the known initial concentration of the reactant, can then be interpreted as the value of $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H$ for the reaction.

## Why do you need to know this material?

Thermodynamics gives us the power to derive relations between a variety of properties: this Topic is a first introduction to the manipulation of equations involving state functions. In the process, we obtain such important relations as that between heat capacities. An important technological consequence is the Joule-Thomson effect for cooling gases, which is derived here.

## What is the key idea?

The fact that internal energy and enthalpy are state functions leads to relations between thermodynamic properties.

## What do you need to know already?

You need to be aware that internal energy and enthalpy are state functions (Topics 2B and 2C) and be familiar with heat capacity. You need to be able to make use of several simple relations involving partial derivatives (Mathematical background 2).

A state function is a property that depends only on the current state of a system and is independent of its history. The internal energy and enthalpy are two examples of state functions. Physical quantities that do depend on the path between two states are called path functions. Examples of path functions are the work and the heating that are done when preparing a state. We do not speak of a system in a particular state as possessing work or heat. In each case, the energy transferred as work or heat relates to the path being taken between states, not the current state itself.

A part of the richness of thermodynamics is that it uses the mathematical properties of state functions to draw far-reaching conclusions about the relations between physical properties and thereby establish connections that may be completely unexpected. The practical importance of this ability is that we can combine measurements of different properties to obtain the value of a property we require.

## 2D.1 Exact and inexact differentials

Consider a system undergoing the changes depicted in Fig. 2D.1. The initial state of the system is i and in this state the internal energy is $U_{\mathrm{i}}$. Work is done by the system as it expands adiabatically to a state f . In this state the system has an internal energy $U_{\mathrm{f}}$ and the work done on the system as it changes along Path 1 from i to f is $w$. Notice our use of language: $U$ is a property of the state; $w$ is a property of the path. Now consider another process, Path 2, in which the initial and final states are the same as those in Path 1 but in which the expansion is not adiabatic. The internal energy of both the initial and the final states are the same as before (because $U$ is a state function). However, in the second path an energy $q^{\prime}$ enters the system as heat and the work $w^{\prime}$ is not the same as $w$. The work and the heat are path functions.

If a system is taken along a path (for example, by heating it), $U$ changes from $U_{\mathrm{i}}$ to $U_{\mathrm{f}}$, and the overall change is the sum (integral) of all the infinitesimal changes along the path:

$$
\Delta U=\int_{\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{~d} U
$$

The value of $\Delta U$ depends on the initial and final states of the system but is independent of the path between them. This pathindependence of the integral is expressed by saying that $\mathrm{d} U$

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-29.jpg?height=527&width=755&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=341)
Figure 2D. 1 As the volume and temperature of a system are changed, the internal energy changes. An adiabatic and a nonadiabatic path are shown as Path 1 and Path 2, respectively: they correspond to different values of $q$ and $w$ but to the same value of $\Delta U$.

is an 'exact differential'. In general, an exact differential is an infinitesimal quantity that, when integrated, gives a result that is independent of the path between the initial and final states.

When a system is heated, the total energy transferred as heat is the sum of all individual contributions at each point of the path:

$$
q=\int_{\mathrm{i}, \text { path }}^{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{~d} q
$$

Notice the differences between this equation and eqn 2D.1. First, we do not write $\Delta q$, because $q$ is not a state function and the energy supplied as heat cannot be expressed as $q_{\mathrm{f}}-q_{\mathrm{i}}$. Secondly, we must specify the path of integration because $q$ depends on the path selected (for example, an adiabatic path has $q=0$, whereas a non-adiabatic path between the same two states would have $q \neq 0$ ). This path-dependence is expressed by saying that $\mathrm{d} q$ is an 'inexact differential'. In general, an inexact differential is an infinitesimal quantity that, when integrated, gives a result that depends on the path between the initial and final states. Often $\mathrm{d} q$ is written đ $q$ to emphasize that it is inexact and requires the specification of a path.

The work done on a system to change it from one state to another depends on the path taken between the two specified states; for example, in general the work is different if the change takes place adiabatically and non-adiabatically. It follows that $\mathrm{d} w$ is an inexact differential. It is often written $\mathrm{d} w$.

## Example 2D. 1 Calculating work, heat, and change in internal energy

Consider a perfect gas inside a cylinder fitted with a piston. Let the initial state be $T, V_{\mathrm{i}}$ and the final state be $T, V_{\mathrm{f}}$. The change of state can be brought about in many ways, of which the two
simplest are the following: Path 1 , in which there is free expansion against zero external pressure; Path 2, in which there is reversible, isothermal expansion. Calculate $w, q$, and $\Delta U$ for each process.

Method To find a starting point for a calculation in thermodynamics, it is often a good idea to go back to first principles and to look for a way of expressing the quantity we are asked to calculate in terms of other quantities that are easier to calculate. It is argued in Topic 2B that the internal energy of a perfect gas depends only on the temperature and is independent of the volume those molecules occupy, so for any isothermal change, $\Delta U=0$. We also know that in general $\Delta U=q+w$. The question depends on being able to combine the two expressions. Topic 2A presents a number of expressions for the work done in a variety of processes, and here we need to select the appropriate ones.

Answer Because $\Delta U=0$ for both paths and $\Delta U=q+w$, in each case $q=-w$. The work of free expansion is zero (eqn 2A. 7 of Topic 2A, $w=0$ ); so in Path 1, $w=0$ and therefore $q=0$ too. For Path 2, the work is given by eqn 2A. 9 of Topic $2 \mathrm{~A}(w=-n R T \ln \left(V_{\mathrm{f}} / V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ ) and consequently $q=n R T \ln \left(V_{\mathrm{f}} / V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$.

Self-test 2D.1 Calculate the values of $q, w$, and $\Delta U$ for an irreversible isothermal expansion of a perfect gas against a constant nonzero external pressure.

$$
\text { Answer: } q=p_{\mathrm{ex}} \Delta V, w=-p_{\mathrm{ex}} \Delta V, \Delta U=0
$$

## 2D.2 Changes in internal energy

We begin to unfold the consequences of $\mathrm{d} U$ being an exact differential by exploring a closed system of constant composition (the only type of system considered in the rest of this Topic). The internal energy $U$ can be regarded as a function of $V, T$, and $p$, but, because there is an equation of state (Topic 1A), stating the values of two of the variables fixes the value of the third. Therefore, it is possible to write $U$ in terms of just two independent variables: $V$ and $T, p$ and $T$, or $p$ and $V$. Expressing $U$ as a function of volume and temperature fits the purpose of our discussion.

## (a) General considerations

Because the internal energy is a function of the volume and the temperature, when these two quantities change, the internal energy changes by

$$
\mathrm{d} U=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{T} \mathrm{~d} V+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V} \mathrm{~d} T \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { General expression } \\
& \text { for a change in } U \\
& \text { with } T \text { and } V
\end{aligned}
$$

The interpretation of this equation is that, in a closed system of constant composition, any infinitesimal change in the internal

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-30.jpg?height=568&width=814&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=273)
Figure 2D. 2 An overall change in $U$, which is denoted $\mathrm{d} U$, arises when both $V$ and $T$ are allowed to change. If secondorder infinitesimals are ignored, the overall change is the sum of changes for each variable separately.

energy is proportional to the infinitesimal changes of volume and temperature, the coefficients of proportionality being the two partial derivatives (Fig. 2D.2).

In many cases partial derivatives have a straightforward physical interpretation, and thermodynamics gets shapeless and difficult only when that interpretation is not kept in sight. In the present case, we have already met $(\partial U / \partial T)_{V}$ in Topic 2A, where we saw that it is the constant-volume heat capacity, $C_{V}$. The other coefficient, $(\partial U / \partial V)_{T}$, plays a major role in thermodynamics because it is a measure of the variation of the internal energy of a substance as its volume is changed at constant temperature (Fig. 2D.3). We shall denote it $\pi_{T}$ and, because it has the same dimensions as pressure but arises from the interactions between the molecules within the sample, call it the internal pressure:

$$
\pi_{T}=\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_{T} \quad \text { Definition } \quad \text { Internal pressure }
$$

Figure 2D. 3 The internal pressure, $\pi_{T}$, is the slope of $U$ with respect to $V$ with the temperature $T$ held constant.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-30.jpg?height=491&width=787&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=1211)
Figure 2D. 4 For a perfect gas, the internal energy is independent of the volume (at constant temperature). If attractions are dominant in a real gas, the internal energy increases with volume because the molecules become farther apart on average. If repulsions are dominant, the internal energy decreases as the gas expands.

In terms of the notation $C_{V}$ and $\pi_{T}$, eqn 2D. 3 can now be written

$$
\mathrm{d} U=\pi_{T} \mathrm{~d} V+C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

When there are no interactions between the molecules, the internal energy is independent of their separation and hence independent of the volume of the sample. Therefore, for a perfect gas we can write $\pi_{T}=0$. If the gas is described by the van der Waals equation with $a$, the parameter corresponding to attractive interactions, dominant, then an increase in volume increases the average separation of the molecules and therefore raises the internal energy. In this case, we expect $\pi_{T}>0$ (Fig. 2D.4).

The statement $\pi_{T}=0$ (that is, the internal energy is independent of the volume occupied by the sample) can be taken to be the definition of a perfect gas, for in Topic 3D we see that it implies the equation of state $p V \propto T$.

James Joule thought that he could measure $\pi_{T}$ by observing the change in temperature of a gas when it is allowed to expand into a vacuum. He used two metal vessels immersed in a water bath (Fig. 2D.5). One was filled with air at about 22 atm and the other was evacuated. He then tried to measure the change

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-30.jpg?height=348&width=677&top_left_y=2079&top_left_x=1264)
Figure 2D.5 A schematic diagram of the apparatus used by Joule in an attempt to measure the change in internal energy when a gas expands isothermally. The heat absorbed by the gas is proportional to the change in temperature of the bath.

in temperature of the water of the bath when a stopcock was opened and the air expanded into a vacuum. He observed no change in temperature.

The thermodynamic implications of the experiment are as follows. No work was done in the expansion into a vacuum, so $w=0$. No energy entered or left the system (the gas) as heat because the temperature of the bath did not change, so $q=0$. Consequently, within the accuracy of the experiment, $\Delta U=0$. Joule concluded that $U$ does not change when a gas expands isothermally and therefore that $\pi_{T}=0$. His experiment, however, was crude. In particular, the heat capacity of the apparatus was so large that the temperature change that gases do in fact cause was too small to measure. Nevertheless, from his experiment Joule had extracted an essential limiting property of a gas, a property of a perfect gas, without detecting the small deviations characteristic of real gases.

## (b) Changes in internal energy at constant pressure

Partial derivatives have many useful properties and some that we shall draw on frequently are reviewed in Mathematical background 2. Skilful use of them can often turn some unfamiliar quantity into a quantity that can be recognized, interpreted, or measured.

As an example, suppose we want to find out how the internal energy varies with temperature when the pressure rather than the volume of the system is kept constant. If we divide both sides of eqn 2D. 5 by $\mathrm{d} T$ and impose the condition of constant pressure on the resulting differentials, so that $\mathrm{d} U / \mathrm{d} T$ on the left becomes $(\partial U / \partial T)_{p}$, we obtain

$$
\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\pi_{T}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}+C_{V}
$$

It is usually sensible in thermodynamics to inspect the output of a manipulation like this to see if it contains any recognizable physical quantity. The partial derivative on the right in this expression is the slope of the plot of volume against temperature (at constant pressure). This property is normally tabulated as the expansion coefficient, $\alpha$, of a substance, which is defined as

$$
\alpha=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} \quad \text { Definition } \quad \text { Expansion coefficient }
$$

and physically is the fractional change in volume that accompanies a rise in temperature. A large value of $\alpha$ means that the volume of the sample responds strongly to changes in temperature. Table 2D. 1 lists some experimental values of $\alpha$. For future reference, it also lists the isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_{T}$ (kappa), which is defined as

Table 2D.1* Expansion coefficients ( $\alpha$ ) and isothermal compressibilities $\left(\kappa_{T}\right)$ at 298 K
|  | $\alpha /\left(10^{-4} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\right)$ | $\kappa_{T} /\left(10^{-6}\right.$ bar $\left.^{-1}\right)$ |

| Diamond | 0.030 | 0.185 |
| Lead | 0.861 | 2.18 |
| Water | 2.1 | 49.0 |


* More values are given in the Resource section.

$$
\kappa_{T}=-\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \quad \text { Definition Isothermal compressibility }
$$

The isothermal compressibility is a measure of the fractional change in volume when the pressure is increased by a small amount; the negative sign in the definition ensures that the compressibility is a positive quantity, because an increase of pressure, implying a positive $\mathrm{d} p$, brings about a reduction of volume, a negative $\mathrm{d} V$.

Example 2D. 2 Calculating the expansion coefficient of a gas

Derive an expression for the expansion coefficient of a perfect gas.

Method The expansion coefficient is defined in eqn 2D.6. To use this expression, substitute the expression for $V$ in terms of $T$ obtained from the equation of state for the gas. As implied by the subscript in eqn 2D.6, the pressure, $p$, is treated as a constant.

Answer Because $p V=n R T$, we can write

$$
\alpha=\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial(n R T / p)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\frac{1}{V} \times \frac{n R}{p} \frac{\mathrm{~d} T}{\mathrm{~d} T}=\frac{n R}{p V}=\frac{1}{T}
$$

The higher the temperature, the less responsive is the volume of a perfect gas to a change in temperature.

Self-test 2D. 2 Derive an expression for the isothermal compressibility of a perfect gas.

Answer: $\kappa_{T}=1 / p$

When we introduce the definition of $\alpha$ into the equation for $(\partial U / \partial T)_{p}$, we obtain

$$
\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\alpha \pi_{T} V+C_{V}
$$

This equation is entirely general (provided the system is closed and its composition is constant). It expresses the dependence of the internal energy on the temperature at constant pressure
in terms of $C_{V}$ which can be measured in one experiment, in terms of $\alpha$, which can be measured in another, and in terms of the quantity $\pi_{T}$. For a perfect gas, $\pi_{T}=0$, so then

$$
\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=C_{V}
$$

That is, although the constant-volume heat capacity of a perfect gas is defined as the slope of a plot of internal energy against temperature at constant volume, for a perfect gas $C_{V}$ is also the slope at constant pressure.

Equation 2D. 9 provides an easy way to derive the relation between $C_{p}$ and $C_{V}$ for a perfect gas. Thus, we can use it to express both heat capacities in terms of derivatives at constant pressure:

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=\overbrace{\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_{p}}^{\substack{\text { Definition } \\ \text { of } C_{p}}}-\overbrace{\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}}^{\text {eqn 2D.9 }}
$$

Then we introduce $H=U+p V=U+n R T$ into the first term, which results in

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=\left(\frac{\partial(U+n R T)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}-\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=n R
$$

We show in the following Justification that in general

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=\frac{\alpha^{2} T V}{\kappa_{T}}
$$

Equation 2D. 11 applies to any substance (that is, it is 'universally true'). It reduces to eqn 2D. 10 for a perfect gas when we set $\alpha=1 / T$ and $\kappa_{T}=1 / p$. Because expansion coefficients $\alpha$ of liquids and solids are small, it is tempting to deduce from eqn 2D. 11 that for them $C_{p} \approx C_{V}$. But this is not always so, because the compressibility $\kappa_{T}$ might also be small, so $\alpha^{2} / \kappa_{T}$ might be large. That is, although only a little work need be done to push back the atmosphere, a great deal of work may have to be done to pull atoms apart from one another as the solid expands.

## Brief illustration 2D. 1 The relation between heat capacities

The expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility of water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are given in Table 2D. 1 as $2.1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and $4.96 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~atm}^{-1}\left(4.90 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~Pa}^{-1}\right)$, respectively. The molar volume of water at that temperature, $V_{\mathrm{m}}=M / \rho$ (where $\rho$ is the mass density) is $18.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\left(1.81 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)$. Therefore, from eqn 2D.11, the difference in molar heat capacities (which is given by $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in place of $V$ ) is

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}-C_{V, \mathrm{~m}} & =\frac{\left(2.1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\right)^{2} \times(298 \mathrm{~K}) \times\left(1.81 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)}{4.90 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~Pa}^{-1}} \\
& =0.485 \mathrm{~Pa} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}=0.485 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

For water, $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=75.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, so $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=74.8 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. In some cases, the two heat capacities differ by as much as 30 per cent.

A useful rule when doing a problem in thermodynamics is to go back to first principles. In the present problem we do this twice, first by expressing $C_{p}$ and $C_{V}$ in terms of their definitions and then by inserting the definition $H=U+p V$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
C_{p}-C_{V} & =\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_{p}-C_{V} \\
& =\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{p}+\left(\frac{\partial(p V)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}-C_{V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation 2D.8, $(\partial U / \partial T)_{p}=\alpha \pi_{T} V+C_{V}$, lets us write the difference of the first and third terms as $\alpha \pi_{T} V$. We can simplify the remaining term by noting that, because $p$ is constant,

$$
\left(\frac{\partial(p V)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=p\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\alpha p V
$$

Collecting the two contributions gives

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=\alpha\left(p+\pi_{T}\right) V
$$

The first term on the right, $\alpha p V$, is a measure of the work needed to push back the atmosphere; the second term on the right, $\alpha \pi_{T} V$, is the work required to separate the molecules composing the system.
At this point we can go further by using the (Second Law) result proved in Topic 3D that

$$
\boldsymbol{\pi}_{T}=T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}-p
$$

When this expression is inserted in the last equation we obtain

$$
C_{p}-C_{V}=\alpha T V\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
$$

We now transform the remaining partial derivative. With $V$ regarded as a function of $p$ and $T$, when these two quantities change the resulting change in $V$ is

$$
\mathrm{d} V=\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} \mathrm{~d} T+\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \mathrm{~d} p
$$

For the volume to be constant, $\mathrm{d} V=0$ implies that

$$
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} \mathrm{~d} T=-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \mathrm{~d} p \text { at constant volume }
$$

On division by $\mathrm{d} T$, this relation becomes

$$
\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}
$$

and therefore

$$
\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}=-\frac{(\partial V / \partial T)_{p}}{(\partial V / \partial p)_{T}}=\frac{\alpha}{\kappa_{T}}
$$

Insertion of this relation into the expression above for $C_{p}-C_{V}$ produces eqn 2D.11.

## 2D.3 The Joule-Thomson effect

We can carry out a similar set of operations on the enthalpy, $H=U+p V$. The quantities $U, p$, and $V$ are all state functions; therefore $H$ is also a state function and $\mathrm{d} H$ is an exact differential. It turns out that $H$ is a useful thermodynamic function when the pressure is under our control: we saw a sign of that in the relation $\Delta H=q_{p}$ (this is eqn 2B.2b of Topic 2B). We shall therefore regard $H$ as a function of $p$ and $T$, and adapt the argument in Section 2D. 2 for the variation of $U$ to find an expression for the variation of $H$ with temperature at constant volume. As explained in the following Justification, we find that for a closed system of constant composition,

$$
\mathrm{d} H=-\mu C_{p} \mathrm{~d} p+C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

where the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu(\mathrm{mu})$, is defined as

$$
\mu=\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p}\right)_{H} \quad \text { Definition Joule-Thomson coefficient }
$$

This relation will prove useful for relating the heat capacities at constant pressure and volume and for a discussion of the liquefaction of gases.

## Justification 2D. 2 The variation of enthalpy with pressure and temperature

Because $H$ is a function of $p$ and $T$ we can write, when these two quantities change by an infinitesimal amount, the enthalpy changes by

$$
\mathrm{d} H=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \mathrm{~d} p+\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_{p} \mathrm{~d} T
$$

The second partial derivative is $C_{p}$; our task here is to express $(\partial H / \partial p)_{T}$ in terms of recognizable quantities. If the enthalpy is constant, $\mathrm{d} H=0$ and this expression then requires that

$$
\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \mathrm{~d} p=-C_{p} \mathrm{~d} T \text { at constant } H
$$

Division of both sides by $\mathrm{d} p$ then gives

$$
\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{T}=-C_{p}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial p}\right)_{H}=-C_{p} \mu
$$

Equation 2D. 13 now follows directly.

## (a) Observation of the Joule-Thomson effect

The analysis of the Joule-Thomson coefficient is central to the technological problems associated with the liquefaction of gases. We need to be able to interpret it physically and to measure it. As shown in the following Justification, the cunning required to impose the constraint of constant enthalpy, so that the process is isenthalpic, was supplied by Joule and William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). They let a gas expand through a porous barrier from one constant pressure to another and monitored the difference of temperature that arose from the expansion (Fig. 2D.6). The whole apparatus was insulated so that the process was adiabatic. They observed a lower temperature on the low pressure side, the difference in temperature being proportional to the pressure difference they maintained.

Figure 2D.6 The apparatus used for measuring the JouleThomson effect. The gas expands through the porous barrier, which acts as a throttle, and the whole apparatus is thermally insulated. As explained in the text, this arrangement corresponds to an isenthalpic expansion (expansion at constant enthalpy). Whether the expansion results in a heating or a cooling of the gas depends on the conditions.

This cooling by isenthalpic expansion is now called the JouleThomson effect.

## Justification 2D. 3 The Joule-Thomson effect

Here we show that the experimental arrangement results in expansion at constant enthalpy. Because all changes to the gas occur adiabatically, $q=0$ implies that $\Delta U=w$. Next, consider the work done as the gas passes through the barrier. We focus on the passage of a fixed amount of gas from the high pressure side, where the pressure is $p_{\mathrm{i}}$, the temperature $T_{\mathrm{i}}$, and the gas occupies a volume $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ (Fig. 2D.7).

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-34.jpg?height=538&width=867&top_left_y=886&top_left_x=243)
Figure 2D. 7 The thermodynamic basis of Joule-Thomson expansion. The pistons represent the upstream and downstream gases, which maintain constant pressures either side of the throttle. The transition from the top diagram to the bottom diagram, which represents the passage of a given amount of gas through the throttle, occurs without change of enthalpy.

The gas emerges on the low pressure side, where the same amount of gas has a pressure $p_{\mathrm{f}}$, a temperature $T_{\mathrm{f}}$, and occupies a volume $V_{\mathrm{f}}$. The gas on the left is compressed isothermally by the upstream gas acting as a piston. The relevant pressure is $p_{\mathrm{i}}$ and the volume changes from $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to 0 ; therefore, the work done on the gas is

$$
w_{1}=-p_{\mathrm{i}}\left(0-V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)=p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}
$$

The gas expands isothermally on the right of the barrier (but possibly at a different constant temperature) against the pressure $p_{\mathrm{f}}$ provided by the downstream gas acting as a piston to be driven out. The volume changes from 0 to $V_{\mathrm{f}}$, so the work done on the gas in this stage is

$$
w_{2}=-p_{\mathrm{f}}\left(V_{\mathrm{f}}-0\right)=-p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}
$$

The total work done on the gas is the sum of these two quantities, or

$$
w_{1}+w_{2}=p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}-p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}
$$

It follows that the change of internal energy of the gas as it moves adiabatically from one side of the barrier to the other is

$$
U_{\mathrm{f}}-U_{\mathrm{i}}=w=p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}-p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}
$$

Reorganization of this expression gives

$$
U_{\mathrm{f}}+p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}=U_{\mathrm{i}}+p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}} \quad \text { or } \quad H_{\mathrm{f}}=H_{\mathrm{i}}
$$

Therefore, the expansion occurs without change of enthalpy.

The property measured in the experiment is the ratio of the temperature change to the change of pressure, $\Delta T / \Delta p$. Adding the constraint of constant enthalpy and taking the limit of small $\Delta p$ implies that the thermodynamic quantity measured is $(\partial T / \partial p)_{H}$, which is the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu$. In other words, the physical interpretation of $\mu$ is that it is the ratio of the change in temperature to the change in pressure when a gas expands under conditions that ensure there is no change in enthalpy.

The modern method of measuring $\mu$ is indirect, and involves measuring the isothermal Joule-Thomson coefficient, the quantity

$$
\mu_{T}=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\right)_{T} \quad \text { Definition } \begin{aligned}
& \text { Isothermal } \\
& \text { Joule-Thomson } \\
& \text { coefficient }
\end{aligned}
$$

which is the slope of a plot of enthalpy against pressure at constant temperature (Fig. 2D.8). Comparing eqns 2D. 13 and 2D.14, we see (from the last line of Justification 2D.2) that the two coefficients are related by:

$$
\mu_{T}=-C_{p} \mu
$$

To measure $\mu_{T}$, the gas is pumped continuously at a steady pressure through a heat exchanger, which brings it to the required temperature, and then through a porous plug inside a thermally insulated container. The steep pressure drop is measured and the cooling effect is exactly offset by an electric heater placed immediately after the plug (Fig. 2D.9). The energy provided

The electrical heating required to offset the cooling arising from expansion is interpreted as $\Delta H$ and used to calculate $(\partial H / \partial p)_{T}$, which is then converted to $\mu$ as explained in the text.

by the heater is monitored. Because $\Delta H=q_{p}$, the energy transferred as heat can be identified with the value of $\Delta H$. The pressure change $\Delta p$ is known, so we can find $\mu_{T}$ from the limiting value of $\Delta H / \Delta p$ as $\Delta p \rightarrow 0$ and then convert it to $\mu$. Table 2D. 2 lists some values obtained in this way.

Real gases have nonzero Joule-Thomson coefficients. Depending on the identity of the gas, the pressure, the relative magnitudes of the attractive and repulsive intermolecular forces, and the temperature, the sign of the coefficient may be either positive or negative (Fig. 2D.10). A positive sign implies that $\mathrm{d} T$ is negative when $\mathrm{d} p$ is negative, in which case the gas cools on expansion. Gases that show a heating effect ( $\mu<0$ ) at one temperature show a cooling effect ( $\mu>0$ ) when the temperature is below their upper inversion temperature, $T_{1}$ (Table 2D.2, Fig. 2D.11). As indicated in Fig. 2D.11, a gas typically has two inversion temperatures.

## Brief illustration 2D. 2 The Joule-Thomson effect

The Joule-Thomson coefficient for nitrogen at 298 K and 1 atm (Table 2D.2) is $+0.25 \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{bar}^{-1}$. It follows that the change in temperature the gas undergoes when its pressure changes by -10 bar under isenthalpic conditions is

$$
\Delta T \approx \mu \Delta p=+\left(0.25 \mathrm{Kbar}^{-1}\right) \times(-10 \mathrm{bar})=-2.5 \mathrm{~K}
$$

At the same initial temperature and pressure, the molar isothermal Joule coefficient is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{T, \mathrm{~m}} & =-C_{p, \mathrm{~m}} \mu=-\left(29.1 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right) \times\left(+0.25 \mathrm{~K} \mathrm{bar}^{-1}\right) \\
& =-7.3 \mathrm{Jar}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\mu$ is an intensive property but $\mu_{T}$ is extensive (but $\mu_{T, \mathrm{~m}}$, like all molar quantities, is intensive).

Figure 2D. 10 The sign of the Joule-Thomson coefficient, $\mu$, depends on the conditions. Inside the boundary, the blue area, it is positive and outside it is negative. The temperature corresponding to the boundary at a given pressure is the 'inversion temperature' of the gas at that pressure. For a given pressure, the temperature must be below a certain value if cooling is required but, if it becomes too low, the boundary is crossed again and heating occurs. Reduction of pressure under adiabatic conditions moves the system along one of the isenthalps, or curves of constant enthalpy. The inversion temperature curve runs through the points of the isenthalps where their slope changes from negative to positive.

The 'Linde refrigerator' makes use of Joule-Thomson expansion to liquefy gases (Fig. 2D.12). The gas at high pressure is allowed to expand through a throttle; it cools and is circulated past the incoming gas. That gas is cooled, and its subsequent expansion cools it still further. There comes a stage when the circulating gas becomes so cold that it condenses to a liquid.

For a perfect gas, $\mu=0$; hence, the temperature of a perfect gas is unchanged by Joule-Thomson expansion. (Simple adiabatic expansion does cool a perfect gas, because the gas does work, Topic 2E.) This characteristic points clearly to the involvement of intermolecular forces in determining the size of the effect. However, the Joule-Thomson coefficient of a real gas

Figure 2D. 12 The principle of the Linde refrigerator is shown in this diagram. The gas is recirculated, and so long as it is beneath its inversion temperature it cools on expansion through the throttle. The cooled gas cools the high-pressure gas, which cools still further as it expands. Eventually liquefied gas drips from the throttle.

does not necessarily approach zero as the pressure is reduced even though the equation of state of the gas approaches that of a perfect gas. The coefficient behaves like the properties discussed in Topic 1C in the sense that it depends on derivatives and not on $p, V$, and $T$ themselves.

## (b) The molecular interpretation of the Joule-Thomson effect

The kinetic model of gases (Topic 1B) and the equipartition theorem (Foundations B) jointly imply that the mean kinetic energy of molecules in a gas is proportional to the temperature. It follows that reducing the average speed of the molecules is equivalent to cooling the gas. If the speed of the molecules can be reduced to the point that neighbours can capture each other by their intermolecular attractions, then the cooled gas will condense to a liquid.

To slow the gas molecules, we make use of an effect similar to that seen when a ball is thrown into the air: as it rises it slows in response to the gravitational attraction of the Earth and its kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. We saw in Topic 1C that molecules in a real gas attract each other (the attraction is not gravitational, but the effect is the same). It follows that, if we can cause the molecules to move apart from each other, like a ball rising from a planet, then they should slow. It is very easy to move molecules apart from each other: we simply allow the gas to expand, which increases the average separation of the molecules. To cool a gas, therefore, we allow it to expand without allowing any energy to enter from outside as heat. As the gas expands, the molecules move apart to fill the available volume, struggling as they do so against the attraction of their neighbours. Because some kinetic energy must be converted into potential energy to reach greater separations, the molecules travel more slowly as their separation increases. This sequence of molecular events explains the Joule-Thomson effect: the cooling of a real gas by adiabatic expansion. The cooling effect, which corresponds to $\mu>0$, is observed under conditions when attractive interactions are dominant ( $Z<1$, where $Z$ is the compression factor defined in eqn 1C.1, $Z=V_{\mathrm{m}} / V_{\mathrm{m}}^{\circ}$ ), because the molecules have to climb apart against the attractive force in order for them to travel more slowly. For molecules under conditions when repulsions are dominant ( $Z>1$ ), the Joule-Thomson effect results in the gas becoming warmer, or $\mu<0$.

Why do you need to know this material?
Adiabatic processes complement isothermal processes, and are used in the discussion of the Second Law of thermodynamics.

## What is the key idea?

The temperature of a perfect gas falls when it does work in an adiabatic expansion.

What do you need to know already?
This Topic makes use of the discussion of the properties of gases (Topic 1A), particularly the perfect gas law. It also uses the definitions of heat capacity at constant volume (Topic 1B) and constant pressure (Topic 2B), and the relation between them (Topic 2D).

The temperature falls when a gas expands adiabatically (in a thermally insulated container). Work is done, but as no heat enters the system, the internal energy falls, and therefore the temperature of the working gas also falls. In molecular terms, the kinetic energy of the molecules falls as work is done, so their average speed decreases, and hence the temperature falls too.

## 2E. 1 The change in temperature

To calculate the change in temperature that results from a process we focus first on the change in internal energy. The change in internal energy of a perfect gas when the temperature is changed from $T_{\mathrm{i}}$ to $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ and the volume is changed from $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ can be expressed as the sum of two steps (Fig. 2E.1). In the first step, only the volume changes and the temperature is held constant at its initial value. However, because the internal

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/e4adfefe-ef7e-4d4e-b94a-7c45153df361-38.jpg?height=500&width=812&top_left_y=615&top_left_x=1198)
Figure 2E. 1 To achieve a change of state from one temperature and volume to another temperature and volume, we may consider the overall change as composed of two steps. In the first step, the system expands at constant temperature; there is no change in internal energy if the system consists of a perfect gas. In the second step, the temperature of the system is reduced at constant volume. The overall change in internal energy is the sum of the changes for the two steps.

energy of a perfect gas is independent of the volume the molecules occupy (Topic 2A), the overall change in internal energy arises solely from the second step, the change in temperature at constant volume. Provided the heat capacity is independent of temperature, this change is

$$
\Delta U=\left(T_{\mathrm{f}}-T_{\mathrm{i}}\right) C_{V}=C_{V} \Delta T
$$

Because the expansion is adiabatic, we know that $q=0$; then because $\Delta U=q+w$, it follows that $\Delta U=w_{\mathrm{ad}}$. The subscript 'ad' denotes an adiabatic process. Therefore, by equating the two expressions for $\Delta U$, we obtain

$$
w_{\mathrm{ad}}=C_{V} \Delta T \quad \text { Perfect gas Work of adiabatic change (2E.1) }
$$

That is, the work done during an adiabatic expansion of a perfect gas is proportional to the temperature difference between the initial and final states. That is exactly what we expect on molecular grounds, because the mean kinetic energy is proportional to $T$, so a change in internal energy arising from temperature alone is also expected to be proportional to $\Delta T$.

In the following Justification we show that, based on this result, the initial and final temperatures of a perfect gas that undergoes reversible adiabatic expansion (reversible expansion in a thermally insulated container) can be calculated from

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=T_{\mathrm{i}}\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}\right)^{1 / c} \quad c=C_{V, \mathrm{~m}} / R \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { Adiabatic, } \\
& \text { reversible, } \\
& \text { perfect } \\
& \text { gas }
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { Final } \\
& \text { tempera- } \\
& \text { ture }
\end{aligned} \quad \text { (2E.2a) }
$$

By raising each side of this expression to the power $c$, an equivalent expression is

$$
V_{\mathrm{i}} T_{\mathrm{i}}^{c}=V_{\mathrm{f}} T_{\mathrm{f}}^{c} \quad c=C_{V, \mathrm{~m}} / R \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { Adiabatic, } \\
& \text { reversible, } \\
& \text { perfect } \\
& \text { gas }
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { Final } \\
& \text { tempera- } \\
& \text { ture }
\end{aligned}
$$

This result is often summarized in the form $V T^{c}=$ constant.

## Brief illustration 2E. 1 The change in temperature

Consider the adiabatic, reversible expansion of 0.020 mol Ar , initially at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, from $0.50 \mathrm{dm}^{3}$ to $1.00 \mathrm{dm}^{3}$. The molar heat capacity of argon at constant volume is $12.47 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, so $c=1.501$. Therefore, from eqn 2B.2a,

$$
T_{\mathrm{f}}=(298 \mathrm{~K})\left(\frac{0.50 \mathrm{dm}^{3}}{1.00 \mathrm{dm}^{3}}\right)^{1 / 1.501}=188 \mathrm{~K}
$$

It follows that $\Delta T=-110 \mathrm{~K}$, and therefore, from eqn 2E.1, that

$$
w=\left\{(0.020 \mathrm{~mol}) \times\left(12.48 \mathrm{JK}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)\right\} \times(-110 \mathrm{~K})=-27 \mathrm{~J}
$$

Note that temperature change is independent of the amount of gas but the work is not.

Answer: $194 \mathrm{~K},-56 \mathrm{~J},-56 \mathrm{~J}$

## Justification 2E. 1 Changes in temperature

Consider a stage in a reversible adiabatic expansion when the pressure inside and out is $p$. The work done when the gas expands by $\mathrm{d} V$ is $\mathrm{d} w=-p \mathrm{~d} V$; however, for a perfect gas, $\mathrm{d} U=C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T$. Therefore, because for an adiabatic change ( $\mathrm{d} q=0$ ) $\mathrm{d} U=\mathrm{d} w+\mathrm{d} q=\mathrm{d} w$, we can equate these two expressions for $\mathrm{d} U$ and write

$$
C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T=-p \mathrm{~d} V
$$

We are dealing with a perfect gas, so we can replace $p$ by $n R T / V$ and obtain

$$
\frac{C_{V} \mathrm{~d} T}{T}=-\frac{n R \mathrm{~d} V}{V}
$$

To integrate this expression we note that $T$ is equal to $T_{\mathrm{i}}$ when $V$ is equal to $V_{\mathrm{i}}$, and is equal to $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ when $V$ is equal to $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ at the end of the expansion. Therefore,

$$
C_{V} \int_{T_{\mathrm{i}}}^{T_{\mathrm{f}}} \frac{\mathrm{~d} T}{T}=-n R \int_{V_{\mathrm{i}}}^{V_{\mathrm{f}}} \frac{\mathrm{~d} V}{V}
$$

(We are taking $C_{V}$ to be independent of temperature.) Then, because $\int \mathrm{d} x / x=\ln x+$ constant, we obtain

$$
C_{V} \ln \frac{T_{\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\mathrm{i}}}=-n R \ln \frac{V_{\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\mathrm{i}}}
$$

Because $\ln (x / y)=-\ln (y / x)$, this expression rearranges to

$$
\frac{C_{V}}{n R} \ln \frac{T_{\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\mathrm{i}}}=\ln \frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}
$$

With $c=C_{V} / n R$ we obtain (because $\ln x^{a}=a \ln x$ )

$$
\ln \left(\frac{T_{\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)^{c}=\ln \frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}
$$

which implies that $\left(T_{\mathrm{f}} / T_{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{c}=\left(V_{\mathrm{i}} / V_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ and, upon rearrangement, eqn 2E.2.

## 2E.2 The change in pressure

We show in the following Justification that the pressure of a perfect gas that undergoes reversible adiabatic expansion from a volume $V_{\mathrm{i}}$ to a volume $V_{\mathrm{f}}$ is related to its initial pressure by

$$
p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}^{\gamma}=p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}^{\gamma} \quad \text { Perfect gas } \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { Reversible adiabatic } \\
& \text { expansion }
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\gamma=C_{p, \mathrm{~m}} / C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}$. This result is commonly summarized in the form $p V^{\gamma}=$ constant.

## Justification 2E. 2 The relation between pressure and volume

The initial and final states of a perfect gas satisfy the perfect gas law regardless of how the change of state takes place, so we can use $p V=n R T$ to write

$$
\frac{p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}}{p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}}=\frac{T_{\mathrm{i}}}{T_{\mathrm{f}}}
$$

However, from eqn 2E. 2 we know that $T_{\mathrm{i}} / T_{\mathrm{f}}=\left(V_{\mathrm{f}} / V_{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{1 / c}$. Therefore,

$$
\frac{p_{\mathrm{i}} V_{\mathrm{i}}}{p_{\mathrm{f}} V_{\mathrm{f}}}=\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{f}}}{V_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)^{1 / c}, \text { so } \frac{p_{\mathrm{i}}}{p_{\mathrm{f}}}\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}\right)^{1 / c+1}=1
$$

We now use the result from Topic 2B that $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}-C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=R$ to note that

$$
\frac{1}{c}+1=\frac{1+c}{c}=\frac{R+C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}}{C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}}=\frac{C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}}{C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}}=\gamma
$$

It follows that

$$
\frac{p_{\mathrm{i}}}{p_{\mathrm{f}}}\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}\right)^{\gamma}=1
$$

which rearranges to eqn 2E.3.

For a monatomic perfect gas, $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=\frac{3}{2} R$ (Topic 2A) and $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=\frac{5}{2} R$ (from $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}-C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=R$ ), so $\gamma=\frac{5}{3}$. For a gas of nonlinear polyatomic molecules (which can rotate as well as translate; vibrations make little contribution at normal temperatures), $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=3 R$ and $C_{p, \mathrm{~m}}=4 R$, so $\gamma=\frac{4}{3}$. The curves of pressure versus volume for adiabatic change are known as adiabats, and one for a reversible path is illustrated in Fig. 2E.2. Because $\gamma>1$,

Figure 2E. 2 An adiabat depicts the variation of pressure with volume when a gas expands adiabatically. Note that the pressure declines more steeply for an adiabat than it does for an isotherm because the temperature decreases in the former.

an adiabat falls more steeply ( $p \propto 1 / V^{\gamma}$ ) than the corresponding isotherm $(p \propto 1 / V)$. The physical reason for the difference is that, in an isothermal expansion, energy flows into the system as heat and maintains the temperature; as a result, the pressure does not fall as much as in an adiabatic expansion.

## Brief illustration 2E. 2 Adiabatic expansion

When a sample of argon (for which $\gamma=\frac{5}{3}$ ) at 100 kPa expands reversibly and adiabatically to twice its initial volume the final pressure will be

$$
p_{\mathrm{f}}=\left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{i}}}{V_{\mathrm{f}}}\right)^{\gamma} p_{\mathrm{i}}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{5 / 3} \times(100 \mathrm{kPa})=32 \mathrm{kPa}
$$

For an isothermal doubling of volume, the final pressure would be 50 kPa .

Self-test 2E.2 What is the final pressure when a sample of carbon dioxide at 100 kPa expands reversibly and adiabatically to five times its initial volume?

Answer: 13 kPa

end-to-end distance from an equilibrium value is $x=n l$ and, consequently, $\mathrm{d} x=l \mathrm{~d} n=N l \mathrm{~d} v$, and write an expression for the work of extending a DNA molecule. (d) Calculate the work of extending a DNA molecule from $\nu=0$ to $v=1.0$. Hint: You must integrate the expression for $w$. The task can be accomplished easily with mathematical software.

2C. 10 In biological cells that have a plentiful supply of oxygen, glucose is oxidized completely to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ by a process called aerobic oxidation. Muscle cells may be deprived of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ during vigorous exercise and, in that case, one molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of lactic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{COOH}\right)$ by a process called anaerobic glycolysis.

## Problem

2E. 1 The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. The value of $\gamma=C_{p} / C_{V}$ can be inferred if the decrease in pressure is also measured and the constant-pressure heat capacity deduced by combining the two values.

## Mathematical background 2 Multivariate calculus

A thermodynamic property of a system typically depends on a number of variables, such as the internal energy depending on the amount, volume, and temperature. To understand how these properties vary with the conditions we need to understand how to manipulate their derivatives. This is the field of multivariate calculus, the calculus of several variables.

## MB2.1 Partial derivatives

A partial derivative of a function of more than one variable, such as $f(x, y)$, is the slope of the function with respect to one of the variables, all the other variables being held constant (Fig. MB2.1). Although a partial derivative shows how a function changes when one variable changes, it may be used to determine how the function changes when more than one variable changes by an infinitesimal amount. Thus, if $f$ is a function of $x$ and $y$, then when $x$ and $y$ change by $\mathrm{d} x$ and $\mathrm{d} y$, respectively, $f$ changes by

$$
\mathrm{d} f=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y} \mathrm{~d} x+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x} \mathrm{~d} y
$$

where the symbol $\partial$ ('curly d') is used (instead of d) to denote a partial derivative and the subscript on the parentheses indicates which variable is being held constant. The quantity $\mathrm{d} f$ is also called the differential of $f$. Successive partial derivatives may be taken in any order:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x}\right)_{y}
$$

Figure MB2.1 A function of two variables, $f(x, y)$, as depicted by the coloured surface and the two partial derivatives, $(\partial f / \partial x)_{y}$ and $(\partial f / \partial y)_{x^{\prime}}$, the slope of the function parallel to the $x$ - and $y$-axes, respectively. The function plotted here is $f(x, y)=a x^{3} y+b y^{2}$ with $a=1$ and $b=-2$.

## Brief illustration MB2.1 Partial derivatives

Suppose that $f(x, y)=a x^{3} y+b y^{2}$ (the function plotted in Fig. MB2.1) then

$$
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=3 a x^{2} y \quad\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=a x^{3}+2 b y
$$

Then, when $x$ and $y$ undergo infinitesimal changes, $f$ changes by

$$
\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\left(a x^{3}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y
$$

To verify that the order of taking the second partial derivative is irrelevant, we form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(3 a x^{2} y\right)}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=3 a x^{2} \\
& \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x}\right)_{y}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(a x^{3}+2 b y\right)}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=3 a x^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the following, $z$ is a variable on which $x$ and $y$ depend (for example, $x, y$, and $z$ might correspond to $p, V$, and $T$ ).

Relation 1. When $x$ is changed at constant $z$ :

$$
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{z}=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)_{y}+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{z}
$$

## Relation 2

$$
\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{z}=\frac{1}{(\partial x / \partial y)_{z}}
$$

## Relation 3

$$
\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial y}\right)_{z}=-\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_{y}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_{x}
$$

By combining Relations 2 and 3 we obtain the Euler chain relation:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)_{z}\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}\right)_{y}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=-1 \quad \text { Euler chain relation }
$$

## MB2.2 Exact differentials

The relation in eqn MB2.2 is the basis of a test for an exact differential; that is, the test of whether

$$
\mathrm{d} f=g(x, y) \mathrm{d} x+h(x, y) \mathrm{d} y
$$

has the form in eqn MB2.1. If it has that form, then $g$ can be identified with $(\partial f / \partial x)_{y}$ and $h$ can be identified with $(\partial f / \partial y)_{x}$. Then eqn MB2.2 becomes

$$
\left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)_{y} \quad \text { Test for exact differential }
$$

## Brief illustration MB2.2 Exact differentials

Suppose, instead of the form $\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\left(a x^{3}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y$ in the previous Brief illustration, we were presented with the expression

$$
\mathrm{d} f=\overbrace{3 a x^{2} y}^{g(x, y)} \mathrm{d} x+\overbrace{\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right)}^{h(x, y)} \mathrm{d} y
$$

with $a x^{2}$ in place of $a x^{3}$ inside the second parentheses. To test whether this is an exact differential, we form

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(3 a x^{2} y\right)}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=3 a x^{2} \\
& \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right)}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=2 a x
\end{aligned}
$$

These two expressions are not equal, so this form of $\mathrm{d} f$ is not an exact differential and there is not a corresponding integrated function of the form $f(x, y)$.

If $\mathrm{d} f$ is exact, then we can do two things:

- From a knowledge of the functions $g$ and $h$ we can reconstruct the function $f$.
- Be confident that the integral of $\mathrm{d} f$ between specified limits is independent of the path between those limits.

The first conclusion is best demonstrated with a specific example.

## Brief illustration MB2.3 The reconstruction

## of an equation

We consider the differential $\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\left(a x^{3}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y$, which we know to be exact. Because $(\partial f / \partial x)_{y}=3 a x^{2} y$, we can integrate with respect to $x$ with $y$ held constant, to obtain

$$
f=\int \mathrm{d} f=\int 3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x=3 a y \int x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x=a x^{3} y+k
$$

where the 'constant' of integration $k$ may depend on $y$ (which has been treated as a constant in the integration), but not on $x$. To find $k(y)$, we note that $(\partial f / \partial y)_{x}=a x^{3}+2 b y$, and therefore

$$
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(a x^{3} y+k\right)}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=a x^{3}+\frac{\mathrm{d} k}{\mathrm{~d} y}=a x^{3}+2 b y
$$

Therefore

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} k}{\mathrm{~d} y}=2 b y
$$

from which it follows that $k=b y^{2}+$ constant. We have found, therefore, that

$$
f(x, y)=a x^{3} y+b y^{2}+\text { constant }
$$

which, apart from the constant, is the original function in the Brief illustration MB2.1. The value of the constant is pinned down by stating the boundary conditions; thus, if it is known that $f(0,0)=0$, then the constant is zero.

To demonstrate that the integral of $\mathrm{d} f$ is independent of the path is now straight forward. Because $\mathrm{d} f$ is a differential, its integral between the limits $a$ and $b$ is

$$
\int_{a}^{b} \mathrm{~d} f=f(b)-f(a)
$$

The value of the integral depends only on the values at the end points and is independent of the path between them. If $\mathrm{d} f$ is not an exact differential, the function $f$ does not exist, and this argument no longer holds. In such cases, the integral of $\mathrm{d} f$ does depend on the path.

## Brief illustration MB2.4 Path-dependent integration

Consider the inexact differential (the expression with $a x^{2}$ in place of $a x^{3}$ inside the second parentheses):

$$
\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y
$$

Suppose we integrate $\mathrm{d} f$ from $(0,0)$ to $(2,2)$ along the two paths shown in Fig. MB2.2. Along Path 1,

Figure MB2.2 The two integration paths referred to in Brief illustration MB2.4.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\text {Path } 1} \mathrm{~d} f & =\int_{0,0}^{2,0} 3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\int_{2,0}^{2,2}\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y \\
& =0+4 a \int_{0}^{2} \mathrm{~d} y+2 b \int_{0}^{2} y \mathrm{~d} y=8 a+4 b
\end{aligned}
$$

whereas along Path 2,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\text {Path } 2} \mathrm{~d} f & =\int_{0,2}^{2,2} 3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\int_{0,0}^{0,2}\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y \\
& =6 a \int_{0}^{2} x^{2} \mathrm{~d} x+0+2 b \int_{0}^{2} y \mathrm{~d} y=16 a+4 b
\end{aligned}
$$

The two integrals are not the same.

An inexact differential may sometimes be converted into an exact differential by multiplication by a factor known as an integrating factor. A physical example is the integrating factor $1 / T$ that converts the inexact differential $\mathrm{d} q_{\text {rev }}$ into the exact differential dS in thermodynamics (Topic 3A).

## Brief illustration MB2.5 An integrating factor

We have seen that the differential $\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+\left(a x^{2}+2 b y\right) \mathrm{d} y$ is inexact; the same is true when we set $b=0$ and consider $\mathrm{d} f=3 a x^{2} y \mathrm{~d} x+a x^{2} \mathrm{~d} y$ instead. Suppose we multiply this $\mathrm{d} f$ by $x^{m} y^{n}$ and write $x^{m} y^{n} \mathrm{~d} f=\mathrm{d} f^{\prime}$, then we obtain

$$
\mathrm{d} f^{\prime}=\overbrace{3 a x^{m+2} y^{n+1}}^{g(x, y)} \mathrm{d} x+\overbrace{a x^{m+2} y^{n}}^{h(x, y)} \mathrm{d} y
$$

We evaluate the following two partial derivatives:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(3 a x^{m+2} y^{n+1}\right)}{\partial y}\right)_{x}=3 a(n+1) x^{m+2} y^{n} \\
& \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=\left(\frac{\partial\left(a x^{m+2} y^{n}\right)}{\partial x}\right)_{y}=a(m+2) x^{m+1} y^{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the new differential to be exact, these two partial derivatives must be equal, so we write

$$
3 a(n+1) x^{m+2} y^{n}=a(m+2) x^{m+1} y^{n}
$$

which simplifies to

$$
3(n+1) x=m+2
$$

The only solution that is independent of $x$ is $n=-1$ and $m=-2$. It follows that

$$
\mathrm{d} f^{\prime}=3 a \mathrm{~d} x+(a / y) \mathrm{d} y
$$

is an exact differential. By the procedure already illustrated, its integrated form is $f^{\prime}(x, y)=3 a x+a \ln y+$ constant.
