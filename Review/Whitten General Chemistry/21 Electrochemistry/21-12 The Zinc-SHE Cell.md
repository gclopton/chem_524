# 21-12 The Zinc-SHE Cell

This cell consists of a SHE in one beaker and a strip of zinc immersed in $1 M$ zinc chloride solution in another beaker (Figure 21-9). A wire and a salt bridge complete the circuit. When the circuit is closed, the following observations can be made.

1. The initial potential of the cell is 0.763 volt.
2. As the cell operates, the mass of the zinc electrode decreases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions increases in the solution around the zinc electrode.
3. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration decreases in the SHE. Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced.

We can conclude from these observations that the following half-reactions and cell reaction occur.

|  |  | $\frac{\boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}}}{}$ |  |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | :--- |
| (oxidation, anode) | Zn | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-}$ | 0.763 V |
| (reduction, cathode) | $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-}$ | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}$ | 0.000 V |
| (cell reaction) | $\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2}$ | $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=0.763 \mathrm{~V}$ |
| (by definition) |  |  |  |

The standard potential at the anode plus the standard potential at the cathode gives the standard cell potential. The potential of the SHE is 0.000 volts, and the standard cell potential is found to be 0.763 volt. So the standard potential of the zinc anode in this cell must be 0.763 volt. The $\mathrm{Zn}\left|\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(1.0 M) \| \mathrm{H}^{+}(1.0 M), \mathrm{H}_{2}(1 \mathrm{~atm})\right| \mathrm{Pt}$ cell is depicted in Figure 21-9.

Note that in this cell, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, so the SHE is the cathode. At the other electrode, metallic zinc is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, so the zinc electrode is the anode in this cell.

The idea of "electron pressure" helps us to understand this process. The positive potential for the half-reaction

$$
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=+0.763 \mathrm{~V}
$$

says that this oxidation is more favorable than the corresponding oxidation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$,

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \quad E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=0.000 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Before they are connected, each half-cell builds up a supply of electrons waiting to be released, thus generating an electron pressure. The process with the more positive $E^{0}$ value is favored, so we reason that the electron pressure generated at the Zn electrode is greater than that at the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ electrode. As a result, when the cell is connected, the electrons released by the oxidation of Zn flow through the wire from the Zn electrode to the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ electrode, where

The superscript in $E^{0}$ indicates thermodynamic standard-state conditions.

What we have informally called "electron pressure" is the tendency to undergo oxidation.

$$

$$

In this cell, the standard hydrogen electrode functions as the cathode.

Recall that in the Zn-SHE cell the SHE was the cathode.

When we reverse the Cu half-reaction to write it as an oxidation, we must reverse its sign.
