# 21-4 The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride

Consider the electrolysis of a moderately concentrated solution of NaCl in water, using inert electrodes. The following experimental observations are made when a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes of a suitable cell.

1. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas is liberated at one electrode. The solution becomes basic in that vicinity.
2. $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gas is liberated at the other electrode.

Chloride ions are obviously being oxidized to $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ in this cell, as they were in the electrolysis of molten NaCl . But $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are not reduced to metallic Na . Instead, gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and aqueous $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions are produced by reduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules at the cathode. Water is more easily reduced than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions. This is primarily because the reduction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$would produce the very active metal Na , whereas the reduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ produces the more stable products $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})$. The active metals Li , $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Ca}$, and Na (Table 6-9) all react with water to produce $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and NaOH , so we do not expect these metals to be produced in aqueous solution. Later in this chapter (Section 21-14), we learn the quantitative basis for predicting which of several possible oxidations or reductions is favored. The half-reactions and overall cell reaction for this electrolysis are

The cell is illustrated in Figure 21-3. As before, the battery forces the electrons to flow from the anode ( + ) through the wire to the cathode ( - ).

The overall cell reaction produces gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ and an aqueous solution of NaOH , called caustic soda. Solid NaOH is then obtained by evaporation of the solution. This is the most important commercial preparation of each of these substances. It is much less expensive than the electrolysis of molten NaCl because it is not necessary to heat the solution to the high temperatures needed to melt NaCl .

> Figure 21-3 Electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution. Although several reactions occur at both the anode and the cathode, the net result is the production of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and NaOH at the cathode and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ at the anode. A few drops of phenolphthalein indicator were added to the solution. The solution turns pink at the cathode, where $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions are formed and the solution becomes basic.
