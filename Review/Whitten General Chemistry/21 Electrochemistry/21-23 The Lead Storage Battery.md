# 21-23 The Lead Storage Battery

The lead storage battery is depicted in Figure 21-17. One group of lead plates contains compressed spongy lead. These alternate with a group of lead plates composed of lead(IV) oxide, $\mathrm{PbO}_{2}$. The electrodes are immersed in a solution of about $40 \%$ sulfuric acid. When the cell discharges, the spongy lead is oxidized to lead ions, and the lead plates accumulate a negative charge.

$$
\mathrm{Pb} \longrightarrow \mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \text {(oxidation) }
$$

The lead ions then react with hydrogen sulfate ions from the sulfuric acid to form insoluble lead(II) sulfate. This begins to coat the lead electrode.

$$
\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+} \quad \text { (precipitation) }
$$

Thus, the net process at the anode during discharge is

$$
\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (anode during discharge) }
$$

The electrons travel through the external circuit and reenter the cell at the $\mathrm{PbO}_{2}$ electrode, which is the cathode during discharge. Here, in the presence of hydrogen ions, the lead(IV) oxide is reduced to lead(II) ions, $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. These ions also react with $\mathrm{HSO}_{4}{ }^{-}$ions from the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ to form an insoluble $\mathrm{PbSO}_{4}$ coating on the lead(IV) oxide electrode.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{PbO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (reduction) } \\
\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+} & \text {(precipitation) } \\
\hline \mathrm{PbO}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (cathode during discharge) }
\end{array}
$$

The net cell reaction for discharge and its standard potential are obtained by adding the net anode and cathode half-reactions and their tabulated potentials. The tabulated $E^{0}$ value for the anode half-reaction is reversed in sign because it occurs as oxidation during discharge.

The decrease in the concentration of sulfuric acid provides an easy method for measuring the degree of discharge because the density of the solution decreases accordingly.

One cell creates a potential of about 2 volts. Automobile 12 -volt batteries have six cells connected in series. The potential declines only slightly during use, because solid reactants are being consumed. As the cell is used, some $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is consumed, lowering its concentration.

When a potential slightly greater than the potential the battery can generate is imposed across the electrodes, the current flow can be reversed. The battery can then be recharged by reversing all the reactions. The alternator or generator applies this potential when the engine is in operation. The reactions that occur in a lead storage battery are summarized as follows.

$$
\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{PbO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \xlongequal[\text { charge }]{\text { discharge }} 2 \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

During many repeated charge-discharge cycles, some of the $\mathrm{PbSO}_{4}$ falls to the bottom of the container and the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentration becomes correspondingly low. Eventually the battery cannot be recharged fully. It can be traded in for a new one, and the lead can be recovered and reused to make new batteries. This is one of the oldest and most successful examples of recycling.
