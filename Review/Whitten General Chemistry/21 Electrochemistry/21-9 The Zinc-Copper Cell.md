# 21-9 The Zinc-Copper Cell

Consider a standard cell made up of two half-cells, one a strip of metallic Cu immersed in $1 M$ copper(II) sulfate solution and the other a strip of Zn immersed in $1 M$ zinc sulfate solution (Figure 21-6). This cell is called the Daniell cell. The following experimental observations have been made about this cell.

1. The initial voltage is 1.100 volts.
2. The mass of the zinc electrode decreases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ increases in the solution around the zinc electrode as the cell operates.
3. The mass of the copper electrode increases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ decreases in the solution around this electrode as the cell operates.

The Zn electrode loses mass because some Zn metal is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions, which go into solution. Thus the Zn electrode is the anode. At the cathode, $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions are reduced to Cu metal. This plates out on the electrode, so its mass increases.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{Zn} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \text {(oxidation, anode) } \\
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\
\hline \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Zn} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} & \text { (overall cell reaction) }
\end{array}
$$

$$
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})
$$

The standard potential of this cell is 1.100 volts.
Electrons are released at the anode and consumed at the cathode. They therefore flow through the wire from anode to cathode, as in all electrochemical cells. In all voltaic cells, the electrons flow spontaneously from the negative electrode to the positive electrode. So, in contrast with electrolytic cells, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive.

> Active Figure (a) A strip of zinc was placed in a blue solution of copper(II) sulfate, $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ (left hand beaker). The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ in solution oxidizes the Zn metal and deposits Cu metal onto the strip of Zn , while the oxidized $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ dissolved. The resulting zinc sulfate solution is colorless (right hand beaker). This is the same overall reaction as the one that occurs when the two half-reactions are separated in the zinc-copper cell (Figure 21-6). (b) No reaction occurs when copper wire is placed in a colorless zinc sulfate solution. The reaction


$$
\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}
$$

is the reverse of the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction in Figure 21-6, so it is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored). Visit this book's companion website at www

To maintain electroneutrality and complete the circuit, two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions from the salt bridge migrate into the anode solution for every $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ion formed. Two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions migrate into the cathode solution to replace every $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion reduced. Some $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions from the anode vessel and some $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ ions from the cathode vessel also migrate into the salt bridge. Neither $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$nor $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions are oxidized or reduced in preference to the zinc metal or $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions.

As the redox reaction proceeds consuming the reactants, the cell voltage decreases. When the cell voltage reaches zero, the reaction has reached equilibrium and no further net reaction occurs. At this point, however, the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion concentration in the cathode cell is not zero. This description applies to any voltaic cell.

Voltaic cells can be represented as follows for the zinc-copper cell.

In this representation, a single line ( $\mid$ ) represents an interface at which a potential develops, that is, an electrode. It is conventional to write the anode half-cell on the left in this notation.

The same reaction occurs when a piece of Zn is dropped into a solution of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$. The Zn dissolves and the blue color of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions disappears. Copper metal forms on the Zn and then settles to the bottom of the container. Because the oxidizing $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions and reducing Zn metal are in direct contact with one another in this arrangement, the electron transfer is "short-circuited," so the spontaneous free energy available to perform work is wasted and simply heats the solution. Only by separating the two half-reactions into separate cells and connecting them with an external wire (circuit) and a salt bridge can one effectively use the electricity generated.

> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: How to tell the anode from the cathode
> The correspondence between the names anode and cathode and the charge on the electrode is different for electrolytic cells than for voltaic (galvanic) cells. The surest way to name these electrodes is to determine what process takes place at each one. Remember the “red cat” mnemonic: reduction occurs at the cathode, regardless of the type of electrochemical cell.
