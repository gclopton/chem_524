# 21-22 Dry Cells

The first dry cell was patented by Georges Leclanché (1839-1882) in 1866, and such cells are still in common use. The container of the Leclanché cell, made of zinc, also serves as one of the electrodes (Figure 21-16). The other electrode is a carbon rod in the center of the cell. The zinc container is lined with porous paper to separate it from the other materials of the cell. The rest of the cell is filled with a moist mixture (the cell is not really dry) of ammonium chloride ( $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}$ ), manganese(IV) oxide ( $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ ), zinc chloride ( $\mathrm{ZnCl}_{2}$ ), and a porous, inert filler. Dry cells are sealed to keep the moisture from evaporating. As the cell operates (the electrodes must be connected externally), the metallic Zn is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, and the liberated electrons flow along the container to the external circuit. Thus, the zinc electrode is the anode (negative electrode).

$$
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The carbon rod is the cathode, at which ammonium ions are reduced.

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \quad \text { (reduction, cathode) }
$$

Addition of the half-reactions gives the overall cell reaction

$$
\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \quad E_{\text {cell }}=1.6 \mathrm{~V}
$$

As $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is formed, it is oxidized by $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ in the cell. This prevents collection of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas on the cathode, which would stop the reaction.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{MnO}(\mathrm{OH})
$$

The mercury battery of the type frequently used in watches, calculators, and hearing aids is a primary cell. Although mercury in the water supply is known to cause health problems, no conclusive evidence has been found that the disposal of household batteries contributes to such problems. Nevertheless, manufacturers are working to decrease the amount of mercury in batteries. In recent years, the amount of mercury in alkaline batteries has decreased markedly; at the same time, the life of such batteries has increased dramatically.

The ammonia produced at the cathode combines with zinc ions and forms a soluble compound containing the complex ions, $\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}$.

$$
\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \longrightarrow\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}
$$

The buildup of reaction products at an electrode is called polarization of the electrode.

This reaction reduces polarization due to the buildup of ammonia, and it keeps the concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ from increasing substantially, which would decrease the cell potential by allowing it to diffuse away from the anode. Under heavy current conditions, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ gas can build up in an ordinary dry cell slowing down the migration of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ions to the cathode. This can cause a temporary reduction of the battery voltage and current, making it appear as if the battery is prematurely dying. On sitting, however, the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ gas has time to react with the $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions to form $\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}$, which can diffuse away more readily from the cathode. Thus, a regular battery can often regain full power after sitting for a while after a period of heavy use. Once the reactant chemicals are sufficiently depleted, however, the battery is "dead."

Alkaline dry cells are similar to Leclanché dry cells except that (1) the electrolyte is basic (alkaline) because it contains KOH , and (2) the interior surface of the Zn container is rough; this gives a larger surface area. Alkaline cells have a longer shelf life than ordinary dry cells, and they stand up better under heavy use. Alkaline batteries give considerably better performance because they do not involve the gas production $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ that occurs in a regular $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}$-based dry cell. The voltage of an alkaline cell is about 1.5 volts.

During discharge, the alkaline dry cell reactions are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 e^{-} \\
2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+2 e^{-} & \text {(anode) } \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{OH})(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{sq})+2 \mathrm{MnO}(\mathrm{OH})(\mathrm{s})\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

## Secondary Voltaic Cells

In secondary voltaic cells, or reversible cells, the original reactants can be regenerated. This is done by passing a direct current through the cell in the direction opposite of the discharge current flow. This process is referred to as charging, or recharging, a cell or battery.

> Figure 21-17 (a) A schematic representation of one cell of a lead storage battery. The reactions shown are those taking place during the discharge of the cell. Alternate lead grids are packed with spongy lead and lead(IV) oxide. The grids are immersed in a solution of sulfuric acid, which serves as the electrolyte. To provide a large reacting surface, each cell contains several connected grids, but for clarity only one of each is shown in (a). Such a cell generates a voltage of about 2 volts. Six of these cells are connected together in series, although only three are shown in (b), so that their voltages add to make a 12 -volt battery.
