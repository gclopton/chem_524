# 21-18 Corrosion Protection

There are several methods for protecting metals against corrosion. The most widely used are

1. Plating the metal with a thin layer of a less easily oxidized metal
2. Connecting the metal directly to a sacrificial anode, a piece of another metal that is more active and therefore is preferentially oxidized
3. Allowing a protective film, such as a metal oxide, to form naturally on the surface of the metal

Compare the potentials for the reduction half-reactions to see which metal is more easily oxidized. The more positive the reduction potential for a metal, the more stable the metal is as the free element and the harder it is to oxidize.

|  | $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}$ | -2.37 V |
| $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}$ | -0.763 V |
| $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}$ | -0.44 V |
| $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Sn}$ | -0.14 V |
| $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$ | +0.337 V |

Acid rain endangers structural aluminum by dissolving this $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ coating.

The thin layer of tin on tin-plated steel cans is less easily oxidized than iron, and it protects the steel underneath from corrosion. It is deposited either by dipping the can into molten tin or by electroplating. Copper is also less active than iron (Table 21-2). It is sometimes deposited by electroplating to protect metals when food is not involved. Whenever the layer of tin or copper is breached, the iron beneath it corrodes even more rapidly than it would without the coating because of the adverse electrochemical cell that is set up.

Figure 21-13a shows an iron pipe connected to a strip of magnesium, a more active metal, to protect the iron from oxidation. The magnesium is preferentially oxidized. It is called a "sacrificial anode." Similar methods are used to protect bridges and the hulls of ships from corrosion. Other inexpensive active metals, such as zinc, are also used as sacrificial anodes. Galvanizing (coating the iron with zinc) combines these two approaches. Even if the zinc coating is broken so the iron is exposed, the iron is not oxidized as long as it is in contact with the more easily oxidized zinc (Figure 21-13c).

Aluminum, a very active metal, reacts rapidly with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the air to form a surface layer of aluminum oxide, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, is so thin that it is transparent. This very tough, hard substance is inert to oxygen, water, and most other corrosive agents in the environment. In this way, objects made of aluminum form their own protective layers and need not be treated further to inhibit corrosion.

> Figure 21-13 (a) Cathodic protection of buried iron pipe. A magnesium or zinc bar is oxidized instead of the iron. The "sacrificial" anode eventually must be replaced. (b) Cathodic protection of a ship's hull. The small yellow horizontal strips are blocks of titanium (coated with platinum) that are attached to the ship's hull. The hull is steel (mostly iron). When the ship is in salt water, the titanium blocks become the anode, and the hull the cathode, in a voltaic cell. Because oxidation always occurs at the anode, the ship's hull (the cathode) is protected from oxidation (corrosion). (c) Galvanizing
