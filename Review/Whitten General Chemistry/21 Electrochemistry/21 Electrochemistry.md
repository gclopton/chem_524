Electrochemistry deals with the chemical changes produced by electric current and with the production of electricity by chemical reactions. Many metals are purified or are plated onto jewelry by electrochemical methods. Digital watches, automobile starters, calculators, and pacemakers are just a few devices that depend on electrochemically produced power. Corrosion of metals is also an electrochemical process.

We learn much about chemical reactions from the study of electrochemistry. The amount of electrical energy consumed or produced can be measured quite accurately. All electrochemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons and are therefore oxidationreduction reactions. The sites of oxidation and reduction are separated physically so that oxidation occurs at one location, and reduction occurs at the other. Electrochemical processes require some method of introducing a stream of electrons into a reacting chemical system and some means of withdrawing electrons. In most applications the reacting system is contained in a cell, and an electric current enters or exits by electrodes.

We classify electrochemical cells into two types.

1. Electrolytic cells are those in which electrical energy from an external source causes nonspontaneous chemical reactions to occur.
2. Voltaic cells are those in which spontaneous chemical reactions produce electricity and supply it to an external circuit.

A few organic salts are liquids at room temperature. These are called ionic liquids.

> Figure 21-1 The motion of ions through a solution is an electric current. This accounts for ionic (electrolytic) conduction. Positively charged ions migrate toward the negative electrode, and negatively charged ions migrate toward the positive electrode. Here the rate of migration is greatly exaggerated for clarity. The ionic velocities are actually only slightly greater than random molecular speeds.


We will discuss several kinds of electrochemical cells. From experimental observations we deduce what is happening at each electrode and for the overall reaction chemistry. We then construct simplified diagrams of the cells.

# 21-1 Electrical Conduction

Electric current represents transfer of charge. Charge can be conducted through metals and through pure liquid electrolytes (that is, molten salts) or solutions containing electrolytes. The former type of conduction is called metallic conduction. It involves the flow of electrons with no similar movement of the atoms of the metal and no obvious changes in the metal (Section 13-17). Ionic, or electrolytic, conduction is the conduction of electric current by the motion of ions through a solution or a pure liquid. Positively charged ions migrate toward the negative electrode, while negatively charged ions move toward the positive electrode. Both kinds of conduction, ionic and metallic, occur in electrochemical cells (Figure 21-1).

# 21-2 Electrodes

Electrodes are surfaces on which oxidation or reduction half-reactions occur. They may or may not participate in the reactions. Those that do not react are called inert electrodes. Regardless of the kind of cell, electrolytic or voltaic, the electrodes are identified as follows.

> The cathode is defined as the electrode at which reduction occurs as electrons are gained by some species. The anode is the electrode at which oxidation occurs as electrons are lost by some species.

Each of these can be either the positive or the negative electrode.

## Electrolytic Cells

In some electrochemical cells, nonspontaneous (reactant-favored) chemical reactions are forced to occur by the input of electrical energy. This process is called electrolysis. An electrolytic cell consists of a container for the reaction material with electrodes immersed in the reaction material and connected to a source of direct current. Inert electrodes are often used so that they do not become involved in the reaction.

> Figure 21-2 (a) Apparatus for electrolysis of molten sodium chloride. (b) The Downs cell, the apparatus in which molten sodium chloride is commercially electrolyzed to produce sodium metal and chlorine gas. The liquid Na floats on the denser molten NaCl .


# 21-3 The Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride (The Downs Cell)

Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity. Its ions vibrate about fixed positions, but they are not free to move throughout the crystal. Molten (melted) NaCl , however, is an excellent conductor because its ions are freely mobile. Consider a cell in which a source of direct current is connected by wires to two inert graphite electrodes

Molten NaCl, melting point $801^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, is a clear, colorless liquid that looks like water.

The Na metal remains liquid because its melting point is only $97.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It floats because it is less dense than the molten NaCl . (Figure 21-2a). They are immersed in a container of molten sodium chloride. When the current flows, we observe the following.

1. A pale green gas, which is chlorine, $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, is liberated at one electrode.
2. Molten, silvery-white metallic sodium, Na , forms at the other electrode and floats on top of the molten sodium chloride.
From these observations we can deduce the processes of the cell. Chlorine must be produced by oxidation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions, and the electrode at which this happens must be the anode. Metallic sodium is produced by reduction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions at the cathode, where electrons are being forced into the cell.

In this chapter, as in Chapters 6 and 11, we often use red type to emphasize reduction and blue type to emphasize oxidation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 e^{-} \\
\frac{2\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-}\right.}{2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}} & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}(\ell)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The formation of metallic Na and gaseous $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ from NaCl is nonspontaneous except at temperatures very much higher than $801^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The direct current (dc) source must supply electrical energy to force this reaction to occur. Electrons are used in the cathode halfreaction (reduction) and produced in the anode half-reaction (oxidation). They therefore

The direction of spontaneous flow for negatively charged particles is from negative to positive.

We will omit the notation that indicates states of substances-(s), ( $\ell$ ), (g), and (aq)-except where states are not obvious. This is a common shortcut when writing equations.

Not surprisingly, the fluctuations in commercial prices of these widely used industrial products- $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, and NaOH -have often paralleled one another.
travel through the wire from anode to cathode. The dc source forces electrons to flow nonspontaneously from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. The anode is the positive electrode and the cathode the negative electrode in all electrolytic cells. Figure 21-2a is a simplified diagram of the cell.

Sodium and chlorine must not be allowed to come in contact with each other because they react spontaneously, rapidly, and explosively to form sodium chloride. Figure 21-2b shows the Downs cell that is used for the industrial electrolysis of sodium chloride. The Downs cell is expensive to run, mainly because of the cost of construction, the cost of the electricity, and the cost of heating the NaCl to melt it. Nevertheless, electrolysis of a molten sodium salt is the most practical means by which metallic Na can be obtained, owing to its extremely high reactivity. Once liberated by the electrolysis, the liquid Na metal is drained off, cooled, and cast into blocks. These must be stored in an inert environment (e.g., in mineral oil) to prevent reaction with atmospheric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or water.

Electrolysis of NaCl in the Downs cell is the main commercial method of producing metallic sodium. The $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gas produced in the Downs cell is cooled, compressed, and marketed. This partially offsets the expense of producing metallic sodium, but most chlorine is produced by the cheaper electrolysis of aqueous NaCl .

# 21-4 The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Chloride

Consider the electrolysis of a moderately concentrated solution of NaCl in water, using inert electrodes. The following experimental observations are made when a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes of a suitable cell.

1. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas is liberated at one electrode. The solution becomes basic in that vicinity.
2. $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gas is liberated at the other electrode.

Chloride ions are obviously being oxidized to $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ in this cell, as they were in the electrolysis of molten NaCl . But $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are not reduced to metallic Na . Instead, gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and aqueous $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions are produced by reduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules at the cathode. Water is more easily reduced than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions. This is primarily because the reduction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$would produce the very active metal Na , whereas the reduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ produces the more stable products $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})$. The active metals Li , $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Ca}$, and Na (Table 6-9) all react with water to produce $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and NaOH , so we do not expect these metals to be produced in aqueous solution. Later in this chapter (Section 21-14), we learn the quantitative basis for predicting which of several possible oxidations or reductions is favored. The half-reactions and overall cell reaction for this electrolysis are

The cell is illustrated in Figure 21-3. As before, the battery forces the electrons to flow from the anode ( + ) through the wire to the cathode ( - ).

The overall cell reaction produces gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ and an aqueous solution of NaOH , called caustic soda. Solid NaOH is then obtained by evaporation of the solution. This is the most important commercial preparation of each of these substances. It is much less expensive than the electrolysis of molten NaCl because it is not necessary to heat the solution to the high temperatures needed to melt NaCl .

> Figure 21-3 Electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution. Although several reactions occur at both the anode and the cathode, the net result is the production of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and NaOH at the cathode and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ at the anode. A few drops of phenolphthalein indicator were added to the solution. The solution turns pink at the cathode, where $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions are formed and the solution becomes basic.


# 21-5 The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Sulfate

In the electrolysis of aqueous sodium sulfate using inert electrodes, we observe the following.

1. Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced at one electrode. The solution becomes basic around that electrode.
2. Gaseous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is produced at the other electrode. The solution becomes acidic around that electrode.

As in the previous example, water is reduced in preference to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$at the cathode. Observation 2 suggests that water is also preferentially oxidized relative to the sulfate ion, $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$, at the anode (Figure 21-4).

$$
\begin{aligned}
2\left(2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e^{-}\right. & \left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}\right) \\
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\
\hline 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 e^{-}
\end{aligned} \text {(oxidation, anode) } \text { }
$$

Bromthymol blue indicator has been added to the solution. This indicator turns blue in the basic solution near the cathode (where $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is produced) and yellow in the acidic solution near the anode (where $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is formed).

> The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of KI, another Group 1A–Group 7A salt. At the cathode (left), water is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions, turning the phenolphthalein indicator pink. The characteristic brownish color of aqueous $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ appears at the anode (right). Can you identify which tube is collecting the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas and the name of the electrode producing it (anode or cathode)?

An ampere is usually called an "amp." For comparison, a 100-watt household light bulb uses a current of about 0.8 ampere.

The net result is the electrolysis of water. This occurs because $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is both more readily reduced than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and more readily oxidized than $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. The ions of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ conduct the current through the solution, but they take no part in the reaction.

# 21-6 Counting Electrons: Coulometry and Faraday's Law of Electrolysis

In 1832-1833, Michael Faraday's studies of electrolysis led to this conclusion.

> The amount of substance that undergoes oxidation or reduction at each electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of electricity that passes through the cell.

This is Faraday's Law of Electrolysis. A quantitative unit of electricity is now called the faraday.

One faraday is the amount of electricity that corresponds to the gain or loss, and therefore the passage, of $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ electrons, or one mole of electrons.

A smaller electrical unit commonly used in chemistry, physics, and electronics is the coulomb (C). One coulomb is defined as the amount of charge that passes a given point when 1 ampere (A) of electric current flows for 1 second. One ampere of current equals 1 coulomb per second. One faraday is equal to 96,485 coulombs of charge.

Table 21-1 shows the amounts of several elements produced during electrolysis by the passage of 1 faraday of electricity. The use of electrochemical cells to relate the amount of reactant or product to the amount of current passed is called coulometry.

Table 21-1 Amounts of Elements Produced at One Electrode in Electrolysis by 1 Faraday of Electricity

| Half-Reaction | Number of $\boldsymbol{e}^{-}$ in Half-Reaction | Product (electrode) | Amount Produced |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{s})$ | 1 | Ag (cathode) | $1 \mathrm{~mol}=107.868 \mathrm{~g}$ |
| $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | 2 | $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ (cathode) | $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~mol}=1.008 \mathrm{~g}$ |

Michael Faraday (1791-1867) is considered the greatest experimental scientist of the 19th century. As a bookbinder's apprentice, he educated himself by extensive reading. Intrigued by his self-study of chemistry and by a lecture given by Sir Humphry Davy, the leading chemist of the day, Faraday applied for a position with Davy at the Royal Institution. He subsequently became director of that laboratory. His public lectures on science were very popular.

> [!example] Example 21-1: Electrolysis
> Calculate the mass of copper metal produced at the cathode during the passage of 2.50 amperes of current through a solution of copper(II) sulfate for 50.0 minutes.

**Plan**

The half-reaction that describes the reduction of copper(II) ions tells us the number of moles of electrons required to produce one mole of copper metal. Each mole of electrons corresponds to 1 faraday, or $9.65 \times 10^{4}$ coulombs, of charge. The product of current and time gives the number of coulombs.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c942e4e5-a003-4e4b-91e8-7898f585fef6-08.jpg?height=98&width=747&top_left_y=1298&top_left_x=360)

**Solution**

The equation for the reduction of copper(II) ions to copper metal is

| $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ | + | $2 e^{-}$ | Cu | (reduction, cathode) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1 mol | $2\left(6.02 \times 10^{23}\right) e^{-}$ |  | 1 mol |  |
| 63.5 g | $2\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |  | 63.5 g |  |

We see that 63.5 grams of copper "plate out" for every 2 moles of electrons, or for every $2\left(9.65 \times 10^{4}\right.$ coulombs) of charge. We first calculate the number of coulombs passing through the cell.

$$
? \mathrm{C}=50.0 \mathrm{~min} \times \frac{60 \mathrm{~s}}{1 \mathrm{~min}} \times \frac{2.50 \mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~s}}=7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C}
$$

We calculate the mass of copper produced by the passage of $7.50 \times 10^{3}$ coulombs.

$$
2 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu}=7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}{9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}} \times \frac{63.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu}}{2 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}=2.47 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { (about the mass } \\
& \text { of a copper penny) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice how little copper is deposited by this considerable current in 50 minutes.

**You should now work Exercises 26 and 32.**

> [!example] Example 21-2: Electrolysis
> What volume of oxygen gas (measured at STP) is produced by the oxidation of water at the anode in the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate in Example 21-1?

The amount of electricity in Examples 21-1 and 21-2 would be sufficient to light a 100-watt household light bulb for about 150 minutes, or 2.5 hours.

When the number of significant figures in the calculation warrants, the value 96,485 coulombs is usually rounded to 96,500 coulombs $\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> Remember that $2.50\,\mathrm{A}=2.50\,\mathrm{C}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Also remember to convert time into seconds when doing these calculations.

A family memento that has been electroplated with copper. To aid in electroplating onto nonconductors, such as shoes, the material is first soaked in a concentrated electrolyte solution to make it conductive.

**Plan**

We use the same approach as in Example 21-1. Here we relate the amount of charge passed to the number of moles, and hence the volume of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas produced at STP.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { current } \\
\times \text { time }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\text { no. of } \\
\text { coulombs }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\text { mol of } e^{-} \\
\text {passed }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \\
\text { of } \mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Solution**

The equation for the oxidation of water and the equivalence between the number of coulombs and the volume of oxygen produced at STP are

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \underset{\substack{1 \mathrm{~mol} \\ 22.4 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}}}}{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\underset{\substack{4\left(6.02 \times 10^{23}\right) e^{-} \\ 4\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)}}{4 e^{-}} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The number of coulombs passing through the cell is $7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C}$. For every $4\left(9.65 \times 10^{4}\right.$ coulombs) passing through the cell, one mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(22.4 \mathrm{~L}$ at STP) is produced.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underline{?} \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2} & =7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}{9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{4 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}} \times \frac{22.4 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}} \\
& =0.435 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 28.**

Notice how little product is formed by what seems to be a lot of electricity. This suggests why electrolytic production of gases and metals is so costly.

# 21-7 Commercial Applications of Electrolytic Cells

Several elements are produced commercially by electrolysis. In Sections 21-3 to 21-5, we described some electrolytic cells that produce sodium (the Downs cell), chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen. Electrolysis of molten compounds is also the common method of obtaining other Group 1A metals, 2A metals (except barium), and aluminum (Section 22-3). Impure metals can also be refined electrolytically, as we will describe for copper in Section 22-8.

Metal-plated articles are common in our society. Jewelry and tableware are often plated with silver. Gold is plated onto jewelry and electrical contacts. Copper is plated onto many objects for decorative purposes (Figure 21-5). Automobiles formerly had steel bumpers plated with thin films of chromium. A chrome bumper required approximately 3 seconds of electroplating to produce a smooth, shiny surface only 0.0002 mm thick. When the metal atoms are deposited too rapidly, they are not able to form extended lattices. Rapid plating of metal results in rough, grainy, black surfaces. Slower plating produces smooth surfaces. "Tin cans" are steel cans plated electrolytically with tin; these are sometimes replaced by cans plated in a fraction of a second with an extremely thin chromium film.

## I Voltaic or Galvanic Cells

Voltaic, or galvanic, cells are electrochemical cells in which spontaneous (product-favored) oxidation-reduction reactions produce electrical energy. The two halves of the redox reaction are separated, requiring electron transfer to occur through an external circuit. In this way, useful electrical energy is obtained. Everyone is familiar with some voltaic cells. The batteries commonly used in flashlights, portable radios, photographic equipment, and many toys and appliances are voltaic cells. Automobile batteries consist of voltaic cells connected in series so that their voltages add. We will first consider some simple laboratory cells used to measure the potential difference, or voltage, of a reaction under study. We will then look at some common voltaic cells.

# 21-8 The Construction of Simple Voltaic Cells

A half-cell contains the oxidized and reduced forms of an element, or other more complex species, in contact with one another. A common kind of half-cell consists of a piece of metal (the electrode) immersed in a solution of its ions. Consider two such half-cells in separate beakers (Figure 21-6). The electrodes are connected by a wire. A voltmeter can be inserted into the circuit to measure the potential difference between the two electrodes, or an ammeter can be inserted to measure the current flow. The electric current is the result of the spontaneous redox reaction that occurs. We measure the potential of the cell.

The circuit between the two solutions is completed by a salt bridge. This can be any medium through which ions can slowly pass. A salt bridge can be made by bending a piece of glass tubing into the shape of a "U," filling it with a hot saturated salt $/ 5 \%$ agar solution, and allowing it to cool. The cooled mixture "sets" to the consistency of firm gelatin. As a result, the solution does not run out when the tube is inverted (Figure 21-6), but the ions in the gel are still able to move. A salt bridge serves three functions.

1. It allows electrical contact between the two solutions.
2. It prevents mixing of the electrode solutions.
3. It maintains the electrical neutrality in each half-cell as ions flow into and out of the salt bridge.

A cell in which all reactants and products are in their thermodynamic standard states ( $1 M$ for dissolved species and 1 atm partial pressure for gases) is called a standard cell.

Anodized aluminum is made by oxidizing a piece of aluminum in an electrolytic cell for a short period of time. The oxidation microscopically dissolves some of the AI surface and coats it with a protective and tough coating of aluminum oxide. This creates a matte finish that can be dyed different colors.

These cells are named for Allesandro Volta (1745-1827) and Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), two Italian physicists of the 18th century.

Neither a voltmeter nor an ammeter generates electrical energy. They are designed to measure electrical voltage or the amount of current flow.

Agar is a porous, gelatinous material obtained from algae.

When we show a concentration in a standard cell as $1 M$, it is assumed to be exactly $1 M$.

## A Spectacular View of One Mole of Electrons

Early in our study of chemistry, we saw that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. We also discussed the incredibly large size of Avogadro's number, $6.022 \times 10^{23}$. Although individual atoms and molecules are invisible to the naked eye, one mole of atoms or molecules is easily detected. Because subatomic particles are even smaller than atoms and also invisible, you might never expect to see individual electrons. Let's consider the possibility, however, of seeing a faraday of charge. A faraday of charge contains Avogadro's number of electrons. Would this collection of $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ electrons be visible? If so, what might it look like? It would look quite spectacular!

Throughout the 1980s, scientists carefully studied data collected during 5 million lightning flashes along the eastern United States. The data were collected by 36 instruments that were collectively known as the National Lightning Detection Network. The investigating scientists found that the electrical currents in lightning flashes over northern Florida measured about $45,000 \mathrm{amps}$, about double the $25,000-\mathrm{amp}$ currents in lightning flashes over the New England states. This study showed that the amount of current flowing during lightning flashes was inversely proportional to the latitude (distance from the equator) of the storm.

One coulomb is the amount of charge that passes a point when a one-ampere current flows for one second ( 1 coulomb $=$ 1 ampere ⋅ second). Thus, a current of $96,500 \mathrm{amps}$ flowing for one second contains Avogadro's number of electrons, or one faraday of charge.

Measurements taken in northern Florida show that a typical two-second lightning strike over that section of the country would transfer approximately Avogadro's number of electrons between the clouds and the earth. So, for those living in northern Florida, a spectacular mental view of one mole of electrons can be obtained by visualizing a two-second lightning strike. Keep in mind that the average lightning strike lasts only a small fraction of a second, and that we can only have a mental view of a two-second lightning strike by extrapolation of what is seen in nature. Because New England lightning strikes produce only about half the current of lightning strikes over northern Florida, people in New England must try to imagine a four-second lightning strike.

# 21-9 The Zinc-Copper Cell

Consider a standard cell made up of two half-cells, one a strip of metallic Cu immersed in $1 M$ copper(II) sulfate solution and the other a strip of Zn immersed in $1 M$ zinc sulfate solution (Figure 21-6). This cell is called the Daniell cell. The following experimental observations have been made about this cell.

1. The initial voltage is 1.100 volts.
2. The mass of the zinc electrode decreases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ increases in the solution around the zinc electrode as the cell operates.
3. The mass of the copper electrode increases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ decreases in the solution around this electrode as the cell operates.

The Zn electrode loses mass because some Zn metal is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions, which go into solution. Thus the Zn electrode is the anode. At the cathode, $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions are reduced to Cu metal. This plates out on the electrode, so its mass increases.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{Zn} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \text {(oxidation, anode) } \\
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\

\end{array}

$$

The standard potential of this cell is 1.100 volts.
Electrons are released at the anode and consumed at the cathode. They therefore flow through the wire from anode to cathode, as in all electrochemical cells. In all voltaic cells, the electrons flow spontaneously from the negative electrode to the positive electrode. So, in contrast with electrolytic cells, the anode is negative and the cathode is positive.

> Active Figure (a) A strip of zinc was placed in a blue solution of copper(II) sulfate, $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ (left hand beaker).

The resulting zinc sulfate solution is colorless (right hand beaker). This is the same overall reaction as the one that occurs when the two half-reactions are separated in the zinc-copper cell (Figure 21-6). (b) No reaction occurs when copper wire is placed in a colorless zinc sulfate solution. The reaction

To maintain electroneutrality and complete the circuit, two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions from the salt bridge migrate into the anode solution for every $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ion formed. Two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions migrate into the cathode solution to replace every $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion reduced. Some $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions from the anode vessel and some $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ ions from the cathode vessel also migrate into the salt bridge. Neither $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$nor $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions are oxidized or reduced in preference to the zinc metal or $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions.

As the redox reaction proceeds consuming the reactants, the cell voltage decreases. When the cell voltage reaches zero, the reaction has reached equilibrium and no further net reaction occurs. At this point, however, the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion concentration in the cathode cell is not zero. This description applies to any voltaic cell.

Voltaic cells can be represented as follows for the zinc-copper cell.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c942e4e5-a003-4e4b-91e8-7898f585fef6-13.jpg?height=246&width=425&top_left_y=695&top_left_x=956)

In this representation, a single line ( $\mid$ ) represents an interface at which a potential develops, that is, an electrode. It is conventional to write the anode half-cell on the left in this notation.

The same reaction occurs when a piece of Zn is dropped into a solution of $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$. The Zn dissolves and the blue color of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions disappears. Copper metal forms on the Zn and then settles to the bottom of the container. Because the oxidizing $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions and reducing Zn metal are in direct contact with one another in this arrangement, the electron transfer is "short-circuited," so the spontaneous free energy available to perform work is wasted and simply heats the solution. Only by separating the two half-reactions into separate cells and connecting them with an external wire (circuit) and a salt bridge can one effectively use the electricity generated.

> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: How to tell the anode from the cathode
> The correspondence between the names anode and cathode and the charge on the electrode is different for electrolytic cells than for voltaic (galvanic) cells. The surest way to name these electrodes is to determine what process takes place at each one. Remember the “red cat” mnemonic: reduction occurs at the cathode, regardless of the type of electrochemical cell.

# 21-10 The Copper-Silver Cell

Now consider a similar standard voltaic cell consisting of a strip of Cu immersed in $1 M \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ solution and a strip of Ag immersed in $1 M \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution. A wire and a salt bridge complete the circuit. The following observations have been made.

1. The initial voltage of the cell is 0.462 volt.
2. The mass of the copper electrode decreases. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion concentration increases in the solution around the copper electrode.
3. The mass of the silver electrode increases. The $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ion concentration decreases in the solution around the silver electrode.

In this cell the Cu electrode is the anode because Cu metal is oxidized to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions. The Ag electrode is the cathode because $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions are reduced to metallic Ag (Figure 21-7).

$$
\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{~s})
$$

The standard potential of this cell is 0.462 volt. This standard cell can be represented as $\mathrm{Cu}\left|\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(1 M) \| \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(1 M)\right| \mathrm{Ag}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{Cu} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \text {(oxidation, anode) } \\
2\left(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e^{-}\right. & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ag}) & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\
\hline \mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag} & \text { (overall cell reaction) }
\end{array}
$$

KCl is not used in this salt bridge because the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions would react with $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions to form insoluble $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$.

As before, ions from the salt bridge migrate to maintain electroneutrality. Some $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions (from the cathode vessel) and some $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions (from the anode vessel) also migrate into the salt bridge.

Recall that in the zinc-copper cell the copper electrode was the cathode; now in the copper-silver cell the copper electrode has become the anode.

Whether a particular electrode acts as an anode or a cathode in a voltaic cell depends on what the other electrode of the cell is.

The two cells we have described show that the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion is more easily reduced (is a stronger oxidizing agent) than $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, so $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ oxidizes metallic zinc to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. By contrast, the $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ion is more easily reduced (is a stronger oxidizing agent) than $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, so $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$oxidizes Cu atoms to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$. Conversely, metallic Zn is a stronger reducing agent than metallic Cu , and metallic Cu is a stronger reducing agent than metallic Ag . We can now arrange the species we have studied in order of increasing strength as oxidizing agents and as reducing agents.

Results such as these form the basis for the activity series (Table 4-14).

A spiral of copper wire is placed in a colorless solution of silver nitrate, $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$. The silver is gradually displaced from solution and adheres to the wire. The resulting copper nitrate solution is blue.

The same spontaneous (product-favored) reaction occurs when the two half-reactions are separated in the copper-silver cell (Figure 21-7).

No reaction occurs when silver wire is placed in a blue copper sulfate solution. The reaction

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}

## Standard Electrode Potentials

The potentials of the standard zinc-copper and copper-silver voltaic cells are 1.100 volts and 0.462 volt, respectively. The magnitude of a cell's potential measures the spontaneity of its redox reaction. Higher (more positive) cell potentials indicate greater driving force for the reaction as written. Under standard conditions, the oxidation of metallic Zn by $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions has a greater tendency to go toward completion than does the oxidation of metallic Cu by $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions. It is convenient to separate the total cell potential into the individual contributions of the two half-reactions. This lets us determine the relative tendencies of particular oxidation or reduction half-reactions to occur. Such information gives us a quantitative basis for specifying strengths of oxidizing and reducing agents. In the next several sections, we shall see how this is done for standard half-cells.

# 21-11 The Standard Hydrogen Electrode

Every oxidation must be accompanied by a reduction (i.e., the electrons must have somewhere to go). So it is impossible to determine experimentally the potential of any single electrode. We therefore establish an arbitrary standard. The conventional reference electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This electrode contains a piece of metal electrolytically coated with a grainy black surface of inert platinum metal, immersed in a $1 M \mathrm{H}^{+}$ solution. Hydrogen, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, is bubbled at 1 atm pressure through a glass envelope over the platinized electrode (Figure 21-8).

By international convention, the standard hydrogen electrode is arbitrarily assigned a

| SHE Half-Reaction | $\boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}}$ (standard electrode potential) |  |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-}$ | exactly $0.0000 \ldots \mathrm{~V}$ | (SHE as anode) |
| $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}$ | exactly $0.0000 \ldots \mathrm{~V}$ | (SHE as cathode) |

As we shall see in Section 21-14, this arbitrary definition will provide a basis on which to describe the relative potential (and hence the relative spontaneity) of any half-cell process. We can construct a standard cell consisting of a standard hydrogen electrode and some other standard electrode (half-cell). Because the defined electrode potential of the SHE contributes exactly 0 volts to the sum, the voltage of the overall cell is then attributed entirely to the other half-cell.

# 21-12 The Zinc-SHE Cell

This cell consists of a SHE in one beaker and a strip of zinc immersed in $1 M$ zinc chloride solution in another beaker (Figure 21-9). A wire and a salt bridge complete the circuit. When the circuit is closed, the following observations can be made.

1. The initial potential of the cell is 0.763 volt.
2. As the cell operates, the mass of the zinc electrode decreases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions increases in the solution around the zinc electrode.
3. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration decreases in the SHE. Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced.

We can conclude from these observations that the following half-reactions and cell reaction occur.

|  |  | $\frac{\boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}}}{}$ |  |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | :--- |
| (oxidation, anode) | Zn | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-}$ | 0.763 V |
| (reduction, cathode) | $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-}$ | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}$ | 0.000 V |
| (cell reaction) | $\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ | $\longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2}$ | $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=0.763 \mathrm{~V}$ |
| (by definition) |  |  |  |

The standard potential at the anode plus the standard potential at the cathode gives the standard cell potential. The potential of the SHE is 0.000 volts, and the standard cell potential is found to be 0.763 volt. So the standard potential of the zinc anode in this cell must be 0.763 volt. The $\mathrm{Zn}\left|\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(1.0 M) \| \mathrm{H}^{+}(1.0 M), \mathrm{H}_{2}(1 \mathrm{~atm})\right| \mathrm{Pt}$ cell is depicted in Figure 21-9.

Note that in this cell, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, so the SHE is the cathode. At the other electrode, metallic zinc is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, so the zinc electrode is the anode in this cell.

The idea of "electron pressure" helps us to understand this process. The positive potential for the half-reaction

$$
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=+0.763 \mathrm{~V}
$$

says that this oxidation is more favorable than the corresponding oxidation of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$,

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \quad E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=0.000 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Before they are connected, each half-cell builds up a supply of electrons waiting to be released, thus generating an electron pressure. The process with the more positive $E^{0}$ value is favored, so we reason that the electron pressure generated at the Zn electrode is greater than that at the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ electrode. As a result, when the cell is connected, the electrons released by the oxidation of Zn flow through the wire from the Zn electrode to the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ electrode, where

The superscript in $E^{0}$ indicates thermodynamic standard-state conditions.

What we have informally called "electron pressure" is the tendency to undergo oxidation.

$$
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

In this cell, the standard hydrogen electrode functions as the cathode.

Recall that in the Zn-SHE cell the SHE was the cathode.

When we reverse the Cu half-reaction to write it as an oxidation, we must reverse its sign.

# 21-13 The Copper-SHE Cell

Another voltaic cell consists of a SHE in one beaker and a strip of Cu metal immersed in $1 M$ copper(II) sulfate solution in another beaker. A wire and a salt bridge complete the circuit. For this cell, we observe the following (Figure 21-10).

1. The initial cell potential is 0.337 volt.
2. Gaseous hydrogen is consumed. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration increases in the solution of the SHE.
3. The mass of the copper electrode increases. The concentration of $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions decreases in the solution around the copper electrode.

Thus, the following half-reactions and cell reaction occur.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c942e4e5-a003-4e4b-91e8-7898f585fef6-17.jpg?height=180&width=1148&top_left_y=1774&top_left_x=596)

The SHE functions as the anode in this cell, and $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions oxidize $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions. The standard electrode potential of the copper half-cell is 0.337 volt as a cathode in the Cu-SHE cell.

Again, we can think of $E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}$ in the two half-cells as "electron pressures."

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{Cu} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=-0.337 \mathrm{~V} \\
\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} & E_{\text {oxidation }}^{0}=0.000 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

Now we see that the hydrogen electrode has the higher electron pressure (more positive, less negative $\left.E_{\text {oxid }}^{0}\right)$. When the cell is connected, electrons flow through the wire from the hydrogen electrode to the copper electrode. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is oxidized to $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$(anode), and $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ is

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})
$$

# 21-14 Standard Electrode Potentials

We can develop a series of representative electrode potentials by measuring the potentials of other standard electrodes versus the SHE in the way we have described for the standard Zn -SHE and standard Cu -SHE voltaic cells. The standard electrode potential for any half-cell is its potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode, measured at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

The activity series (Table 6-9) is based on standard electrode potentials. when the concentration of each ion in the solution is $1 M$ and the pressure of any gas involved is 1 atm .

By agreement, we always tabulate the standard electrode potential for each half-cell as a reduction process.

Many electrodes involve metals or nonmetals in contact with their ions. We saw (Section 21-12) that the standard Zn electrode behaves as the anode versus the SHE and that the standard oxidation potential for the Zn half-cell is 0.763 volt.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c942e4e5-a003-4e4b-91e8-7898f585fef6-18.jpg?height=142&width=1055&top_left_y=1943&top_left_x=164)

The reduction potential for the standard zinc electrode (to act as a cathode relative to the SHE) is therefore the negative of this, or -0.763 volt.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/c942e4e5-a003-4e4b-91e8-7898f585fef6-18.jpg?height=138&width=1049&top_left_y=2192&top_left_x=168)

toward the SHE. Electrodes with positive $E^{0}$ values for reduction half-reactions act as cathodes versus the SHE. Those with negative $E^{0}$ values for reduction half-reactions act as anodes versus the SHE.

| Electrodes with Positive $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ | Electrodes with Negative $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Reduction occurs more readily than the reduction of $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. | Reduction is more difficult than the reduction of $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. |
| Electrode acts as a cathode versus the SHE (which acts as the anode). | Electrode acts as an anode versus the SHE (which acts as the cathode). |

> The more positive the $E^{0}$ value for a half-reaction, the greater the tendency for the half-reaction to occur in the forward direction as written. Conversely, the more negative the $E^{0}$ value for a half-reaction, the greater the tendency for the half-reaction to occur in the reverse direction as written.

Table 21-2 lists standard reduction potentials for a few elements.

1. The species on the left side are all cations of metals, hydrogen ions, or elemental nonmetals. These are all oxidizing agents (oxidized forms of the elements). Their strengths as oxidizing agents increase from top to bottom, that is, as the $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ values become more positive. Fluorine, $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, is the strongest oxidizing agent, and $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ is a very weak oxidizing agent.
2. The species on the right side are free metals, hydrogen, or anions of nonmetals. These are all reducing agents (reduced forms of the elements). Their strengths as reducing agents increase from bottom to top, that is, as the $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ values become more negative. Metallic Li is a very strong reducing agent, and $\mathrm{F}^{-}$is a very weak reducing agent.

> The more positive the reduction potential, the stronger the species on the left is as an oxidizing agent and the weaker the species on the right is as a reducing agent.

# 21-15 Uses of Standard Electrode Potentials

The most important application of electrode potentials is the prediction of the spontaneity of redox reactions. Standard electrode potentials can be used to determine the spontaneity of redox reactions in general, whether or not the reactions can take place in electrochemical cells.

Suppose we ask the question: At standard conditions, will $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions oxidize metallic Zn to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions, or will $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions oxidize metallic copper to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ? One of the two possible reactions is spontaneous, and the reverse reaction is nonspontaneous. We must determine which one is spontaneous. We already know the answer to this question from experimental results (Section 21-9), but let us demonstrate the procedure for predicting the spontaneous reaction from known values of standard electrode potentials.

1. Choose the appropriate half-reactions from a table of standard reduction potentials.
2. Write the equation for the half-reaction with the more positive (or less negative) $E^{0}$ value for reduction, along with its potential.
3. Write the equation for the other half-reaction as an oxidation and write its oxidation potential; to do this, reverse the tabulated reduction half-reaction and change the sign of $E^{0}$. (Reversing a half-reaction or a complete reaction also changes the sign of its potential.)

4. Balance the electron transfer. We do not multiply the potentials by the numbers used to balance the electron transfer! The reason is that each potential represents a tendency for a reaction process to occur relative to the SHE; this does not depend on how many times it occurs. An electric potential is an intensive property.
5. Add the reduction and oxidation half-reactions, and add the reduction and oxidation potentials. $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ will be positive for the resulting overall cell reaction. This indicates that the reaction as written is product-favored (spontaneous). A negative $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ value would indicate that the reaction is reactant-favored (nonspontaneous).

> [!equation] Standard cell potential from half-cell potentials
> $$
> E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=E_{\text {cathode }}^{0}-E_{\text {anode }}^{0}
> $$

For the cell described here, the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cu}$ couple has the more positive reduction potential, so we keep it as the reduction half-reaction and reverse the other half-reaction. Following the steps outlined, we obtain the equation for the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} & +0.337 \mathrm{~V} \longleftarrow \text { reduction potential } \\
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & +0.763 \mathrm{~V} \longleftarrow \text { oxidation potential } \\
\hline \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+1.100 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

The positive $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ value tells us that the forward reaction is spontaneous (product-favored) at standard conditions. So we conclude that copper(II) ions oxidize metallic zinc to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions as they are reduced to metallic copper. (Section 21-9 shows that the potential of the standard zinc-copper voltaic cell is 1.100 volts. This is the spontaneous reaction that occurs.)

> [!note] Stop and Think
> It is important to change the sign of $E^{0}$ whenever you reverse a half-reaction, but **do not** multiply $E^{0}$ values by the factors used to balance electrons. Electric potential is an intensive property.

Platinum metal is often used as the inert electrode material. These two standard half-cells could be shown in shorthand notation as
$\mathrm{Pt} \mid \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}(1 M), \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}(1 M) \quad$ and $\mathrm{Pt} \mid \mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}{ }^{2-}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}(1 \mathrm{M})$

> [!note] Stop and Think
> If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ appears in a half-reaction, the solution is acidic. If $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ appears, the solution is basic.

The reverse reaction has a negative $E^{0}$ and is nonspontaneous.
nonspontaneous
reaction:

$$
\mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Zn} \quad E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=-1.100 \text { volts }
$$

To make it occur, we would have to supply electrical energy with a potential difference greater than 1.100 volts. That is, this nonspontaneous reaction would have to be carried out in an electrolytic cell.

> [!example] Example 21-3: Predicting the direction of a redox reaction
> At standard conditions, will chromium(III) ions, $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$, oxidize metallic copper to copper(II) ions, $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, or will $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ oxidize metallic chromium to $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ions? Write the equation for the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction and calculate $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ for this reaction.

**Plan**

We refer to the table of standard reduction potentials and choose the two appropriate half-reactions.

**Solution**

The copper half-reaction has the more positive reduction potential, so we write it first. Then we write the chromium half-reaction as an oxidation, balance the electron transfer, and add the two half-reactions and their potentials.

$$
\begin{array}{rr} 
& \\
\cline { 3 - 3 } 3\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\right) & \boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}} \\
2\left(\mathrm{Cr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+3 e^{-}\right) & (\text {reduction }) \\
\cline { 3 - 3 }(\text { oxidation }) & +0.337 \mathrm{~V} \\
\hline 2 \mathrm{Cr}+3 \mathrm{Cu}^{2+} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+3 \mathrm{Cu} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+1.08 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

Because $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ is positive, we know that the reaction is product-favored (spontaneous).
$\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions spontaneously oxidize metallic Cr to $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ions and are reduced to metallic Cu .

**You should now work Exercise 58a.**

> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: The sign of $E_{\text{cell}}^{0}$ indicates spontaneity
> For a reaction that is spontaneous at standard conditions, $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ must be positive. A negative value of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ indicates that the reverse of the reaction written would be spontaneous at standard conditions.

# 21-16 Standard Electrode Potentials for Other Half-Reactions

In some half-cells, the oxidized and reduced species are both in solution as ions in contact with inert electrodes. For example, the standard iron(III) ion/iron(II) ion half-cell contains $1 M$ concentrations of the two ions. It involves the following half-reaction.

$$
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \quad E^{0}=+0.771 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The standard dichromate $\left(\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}{ }^{2-}\right)$ ion/chromium(III) ion half-cell consists of a $1 M$ concentration of each of the two ions in contact with an inert electrode. The balanced half-reaction in acidic solution $\left(1.0 M \mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$is

$$
\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}^{2-}+14 \mathrm{H}^{+}+6 e^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad E^{0}=+1.33 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Write the equation for the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction and calculate $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ for this reaction.

**Plan**

We refer to the table of standard reduction potentials (Table 21-3) and choose the appropriate half-reactions.

**Solution**

The $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{NO}$ reduction half-reaction has the more positive $E^{0}$ value, so we write it first and write the $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+} / \mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ half-reaction as an oxidation. We balance the electron transfer and add the two half-reactions to obtain the equation for the spontaneous reaction. Then we add the half-reaction potentials to obtain the overall cell potential.

$$

\end{aligned}
$$

Because $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ is positive for this reaction,

> Pay careful attention to the conditions (acidic or basic) and the half-cell reactions mentioned in the problem. For example, Table 21-3 also includes a half-reaction in which $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ is reduced to $\mathrm{NO}_{2}{ }^{-}$ in basic solution; that is not the correct half-reaction for this question.

> Remember the warning in Step 4 of the procedure set out in Section 21-15: do not multiply potentials by the factors used to balance electron transfer.

Salt ( NaCl ) does not, in itself, do any active corrosion. It merely accelerates the corrosion of most metals, especially steel, by making the water layer more electrically conductive. This makes it easier for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to oxidize the metal, as it makes more direct

> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: What we mean by standard conditions

> 
> 1. The temperature is the standard thermodynamic temperature, $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, unless stated otherwise.
> 2. All reactants and products are at unit activity. This means that:

When one or more of these conditions is not satisfied, we must adjust calculations for nonstandard conditions (Section 21-19).

Now that we know how to use standard reduction potentials, let's see how they explain the reaction that occurs in the electrolysis of aqueous NaCl . The first two electrolytic cells we considered involved molten NaCl and aqueous NaCl (Sections 21-3 and 21-4). There was no doubt that in molten NaCl , metallic Na would be produced by reduction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and gaseous $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ would be produced by oxidation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. But we found in aqueous NaCl , that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, rather than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, was reduced. This is consistent with the less negative reduction potential of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ compared with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

$$
\begin{array}{cc} 
& \frac{E^{0}}{2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}} \\
\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na} & -0.828 \mathrm{~V} \\
& -2.714 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

The more easily reduced species, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, is reduced.
Electrode potentials measure only the relative thermodynamic likelihood for various halfreactions. In practice, kinetic factors can complicate matters. For instance, sometimes the electrode process is limited by the rate of diffusion of dissolved species to or from the electrode surface. At some cathodes, the rate of electron transfer from the electrode to a reactant is the rate-limiting step, and a higher voltage (called overvoltage) must be applied to accomplish the reduction. As a result of such factors, a half-reaction that is thermodynamically more favorable than some other process still might not occur at a significant rate. In the electrolysis of $\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}), \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is oxidized to $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gas ( -1.360 V ), instead of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ being oxidized to form $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas $(-1.229 \mathrm{~V})$, because of the overvoltage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on Pt , the inert electrode.

# 21-17 Corrosion

Ordinary corrosion is the redox process by which metals are oxidized by oxygen, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, in the presence of moisture. There are other kinds, but this is the most common. The problem of corrosion and its prevention are of both theoretical and practical interest. Corrosion is responsible for the loss of billions of dollars annually in metal products. The mechanism of corrosion has been studied extensively. It is now known that the oxidation of metals occurs most readily at points of strain (where the metals are most "active"). Thus, a steel nail, which is mostly iron (Section 22-7), first corrodes at the tip and head (Figure 21-11). A bent nail corrodes most readily at the bend.

A point of strain in a steel object acts as an anode where the iron is oxidized to iron(II) ions, and pits are formed (Figure 21-12).

$$
\mathrm{Fe} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The electrons produced then flow through the nail to areas exposed to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. These act as

> Figure 21-11 (a) A bent nail corrodes at points of strain and "active" metal atoms. (b) Two nails were placed in an agar gel that contained phenolphthalein and potassium ferricyanide, $\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]$. As the nails corrode, they produce $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions at each end and at the bend (an oxidation, so these are anodic regions). $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions react with $\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-}$ ions to form $\mathrm{Fe}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]_{2}$, an intensely blue-colored compound. The rest of each nail functions as the cathode, at which water is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions. The $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions turn phenolphthalein pink.

> Figure 21-12 The corrosion of iron. Pitting appears at the anodic region, where iron metal is initially oxidized to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, and then to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. Rust appears at the cathodic region.


At the same time, the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions migrate through the moisture on the surface. The overall reaction is obtained by balancing the electron transfer and adding the two half-reactions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2(\mathrm{Fe}\left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-}\right) \\
& \mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \begin{array}{l}
\text { (oxidation, anode) } \\
\text { (reduction, cathode) }
\end{array} \\
& \hline 2 \mathrm{Fe}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \\
& \text {(net reaction) }
\end{aligned}
$$

The $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions can migrate from the anode through the solution toward the cathode region, where they combine with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions to form iron(II) hydroxide. Iron is further oxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the +3 oxidation state. The material we call rust is a complex hydrated form of iron(III) oxides and hydroxides with variable water composition; it can be represented as $\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The overall reaction for the rusting of iron is

$$
2 \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{~s})+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s})
$$

# 21-18 Corrosion Protection

There are several methods for protecting metals against corrosion. The most widely used are

1. Plating the metal with a thin layer of a less easily oxidized metal
2. Connecting the metal directly to a sacrificial anode, a piece of another metal that is more active and therefore is preferentially oxidized
3. Allowing a protective film, such as a metal oxide, to form naturally on the surface of the metal

Compare the potentials for the reduction half-reactions to see which metal is more easily oxidized. The more positive the reduction potential for a metal, the more stable the metal is as the free element and the harder it is to oxidize.

|  | $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mg}$ | -2.37 V |
| $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}$ | -0.763 V |
| $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}$ | -0.44 V |
| $\mathrm{Sn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Sn}$ | -0.14 V |
| $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$ | +0.337 V |

Acid rain endangers structural aluminum by dissolving this $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ coating.

The thin layer of tin on tin-plated steel cans is less easily oxidized than iron, and it protects the steel underneath from corrosion. It is deposited either by dipping the can into molten tin or by electroplating. Copper is also less active than iron (Table 21-2). It is sometimes deposited by electroplating to protect metals when food is not involved. Whenever the layer of tin or copper is breached, the iron beneath it corrodes even more rapidly than it would without the coating because of the adverse electrochemical cell that is set up.

Figure 21-13a shows an iron pipe connected to a strip of magnesium, a more active metal, to protect the iron from oxidation. The magnesium is preferentially oxidized. It is called a "sacrificial anode." Similar methods are used to protect bridges and the hulls of ships from corrosion. Other inexpensive active metals, such as zinc, are also used as sacrificial anodes. Galvanizing (coating the iron with zinc) combines these two approaches. Even if the zinc coating is broken so the iron is exposed, the iron is not oxidized as long as it is in contact with the more easily oxidized zinc (Figure 21-13c).

Aluminum, a very active metal, reacts rapidly with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the air to form a surface layer of aluminum oxide, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, is so thin that it is transparent. This very tough, hard substance is inert to oxygen, water, and most other corrosive agents in the environment. In this way, objects made of aluminum form their own protective layers and need not be treated further to inhibit corrosion.

## Effect of Concentrations (or Partial Pressures) on Electrode Potentials

# 21-19 The Nernst Equation

Standard electrode potentials, designated $E^{0}$, refer to standard-state conditions. These standard-state conditions are one molar solutions for ions and one atmosphere pressure for gases with all solids and liquids in their standard states at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. As any of the standard cells described earlier operates, and concentrations or pressures of reactants change, the observed cell voltage drops. Similarly, cells constructed with solution concentrations different from one molar, or gas pressures different from one atmosphere, cause the corresponding potentials to deviate from standard electrode potentials.

The Nernst equation is used to calculate electrode potentials and cell potentials for concentrations and partial pressures other than standard-state values.

> [!equation] Nernst equation (base-10 form)
> $$
> E=E^{0}-\frac{2.303 R T}{n F} \log Q
> $$

where
$E=$ potential under the nonstandard conditions
$E^{0}=$ standard potential
$R=$ gas constant, $8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$
$T=$ absolute temperature in K
$n=$ number of moles of electrons transferred in the reaction or half-reaction
$F=$ faraday, $96,485 \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{mol} e^{-} \times 1 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{C})=96,485 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{mol} e^{-}$
$Q=$ reaction quotient
The reaction quotient, $Q$, was introduced in Section 17-4. It involves a ratio of concentrations or pressures of products to those of reactants, each raised to the power indicated by the coefficient in the balanced equation. The $Q$ expression used in the Nernst equation is the thermodynamic reaction quotient; it can include $b o t h$ concentrations and pressures. Substituting these values into the Nernst equation at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ gives

> [!equation] Nernst equation at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (base-10 form)
> $$
> E=E^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
> $$

> [!note] Stop and Think
> Remember that we refer to thermodynamic standard-state conditions, not standard temperature and pressure as in gas law calculations.

In this equation, the expression following the minus sign represents how much the nonstandard conditions cause the electrode potential to deviate from its standard value, $E^{0}$. The Nernst equation is normally presented in terms of base-10 logarithms, as we will do in this text.

At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the value of $\frac{2.303 R T}{F}$ is 0.0592; at any other temperature, this term must be recalculated. Can you show that this term has the units

Metallic Zn is a pure solid, so its concentration does not appear in $Q$.

The potential for this electrode is lower than $E^{0}$ for the standard $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ electrode, in which both concentrations are 1 M . This should make qualitative sense to you from having studied LeChatelier's Principle. The more products that are present relative to reactants, the less the driving force (lower potential) to make more products.

In general, half-reactions for standard reduction potentials are written

$$
x \mathrm{Ox}+n e^{-} \longrightarrow y \mathrm{Red}
$$

"Ox" refers to the oxidized species and "Red" to the reduced species; $x$ and $y$ are their coefficients, respectively, in the balanced equation. The Nernst equation for any cathode half-cell (reduction half-reaction) is

For the familiar half-reaction involving metallic zinc and zinc ions,

$$
\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn} \quad E^{0}=-0.763 \mathrm{~V}
$$

the corresponding Nernst equation is

$$
E=E^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right]} \quad \text { (for reduction) }
$$

We substitute the $E^{0}$ value into the equation to obtain

$$
E=-0.763 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{2} \log \frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right]}
$$

> [!example] Example 21-5: Nernst equation for a half-cell reaction
> Calculate the potential, $E$, for the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ electrode when the concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is exactly five times that of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$.

**Plan**

The Nernst equation lets us calculate potentials for concentrations other than one molar. The tabulation of standard reduction potentials gives us the value of $E^{0}$ for the reduction half-reaction. We use the balanced half-reaction and the given concentration ratio to calculate the value of $Q$. Then we substitute this into the Nernst equation, with $n$ equal to the number of moles of electrons involved in the half-reaction.

**Solution**

The reduction half-reaction is

$$
\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \quad E^{0}=+0.771 \mathrm{~V}
$$

We are told that the concentration of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is five times that of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, or $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]=5\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$. Calculating the value of $Q$,

$$
Q=\frac{[\mathrm{Red}]^{y}}{[\mathrm{Ox}]^{x}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}=\frac{5\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}=5
$$

The balanced half-reaction shows one mole of electrons, or $n=1$. Putting values into the Nernst equation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =E^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q=+0.771-\frac{0.0592}{1} \log 5=(+0.771-0.041) \mathrm{V} \\
& =+0.730 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 82.**

> [!example] Example 21-6: Nernst equation for an overall cell reaction
> A cell is constructed at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as follows. One half-cell consists of the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ couple in which $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]=1.00 M$ and $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]=0.100 M$; the other involves the $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ couple in acidic solution in which $\left[\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-}\right]=1.00 \times 10^{-2} M$, $\left[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\right]=1.00 \times 10^{-4} M$, and $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=1.00 \times 10^{-3} M$. (a) Find the electrode potential for each half-cell with these concentrations, and (b) calculate the overall cell potential.

**Plan**

(a) We can apply the Nernst equation to find the reduction potential of each half-cell with the stated concentrations. (b) As in Section 21-15, we write the half-reaction with the more positive potential (after correction) along with its potential. We reverse the other halfreaction and change the sign of its $E$ value. We balance the electron transfer and then add the half-reactions and their potentials to find the overall cell potential.

**Solution**

(a) For the $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ half-cell as a reduction,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad E^{0}=+1.507 \mathrm{~V} \\
& E=E^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{8}} \\
&=+1.507 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{5} \log \frac{1.00 \times 10^{-4}}{\left(1.00 \times 10^{-2}\right)\left(1.00 \times 10^{-3}\right)^{8}} \\
&=+1.507 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{5} \log \left(1.00 \times 10^{22}\right)=+1.507 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{5}(22.0) \\
&=+1.246 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) For the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ half-cell as a reduction,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \quad E^{0}=+0.771 \mathrm{~V} \\
& E=E^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]}=+0.771 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{1} \log \frac{0.100}{1.00} \\
&=+0.771 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{1} \log (0.100)=+0.771 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{1}(-1.00) \\
&=+0.830 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

The corrected potential for the $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ half-cell is greater than that for the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ half-cell, so we reverse the latter, balance the electron transfer, and add.

$$
\begin{array}{cr}
\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \frac{\boldsymbol{E} \text { (corrected) }}{+1.246 \mathrm{~V}} \\
5\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}+e^{-}\right) & -0.830 \mathrm{~V} \\
\hline \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+} 4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+5 \mathrm{Fe}^{3+} & E_{\text {cell }}=0.416 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

The cell in Example 21-6 can be represented in shorthand notation as
$\mathrm{Pt}\left|\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}(0.100 M), \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}(1.00 M) \| \mathrm{H}^{+}\left(1.00 \times 10^{-3} M\right), \mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-}\left(1.00 \times 10^{-2} M\right), \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\left(1.00 \times 10^{-4} M\right)\right| \mathrm{Pt}$
The reaction as written is product-favored (spontaneous) under the stated conditions, with a potential of +0.416 volt when the cell starts operation. As the cell discharges and current flows, the product concentrations, $\left[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\right]$ and $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right]$, increase. At the same time, reactant concentrations, $\left[\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-}\right],\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]$, decrease. This increases the magnitude of $\log Q_{\text {cell }}$, so the correction factor becomes more negative. Thus, the overall $E_{\text {cell }}$ decreases (the reaction becomes less favorable). Eventually the cell potential approaches zero (equilib-

Can you write the shorthand notation for this cell?

When evaluating $Q$ in the Nernst equation, remember that (a) molar concentrations are used for dissolved species, and (b) partial pressures of gases are expressed in atmospheres. Units are omitted.

Now solve Example 21-6 by applying the Nernst equation to the overall cell reaction to determine the cell potential.

We can also find the cell potential for a nonstandard cell by first finding $E^{0}{ }_{\text {cell }}$ for the overall standard cell reaction, and then using the Nernst equation to correct for nonstandard concentrations. The next example illustrates this approach.

> [!example] Example 21-7: Nernst equation for an overall cell reaction
> A cell is constructed at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as follows. One half-cell consists of a chlorine/chloride, $\mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, electrode with the partial pressure of $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}=0.100 \mathrm{~atm}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]=0.100 \mathrm{M}$. The other half-cell involves the $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ couple in acidic solution with $\left[\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-}\right]=0.100 M,\left[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\right]=0.100 M$, and $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=0.100 M$. Apply the Nernst equation to the overall cell reaction to determine the cell potential for this cell.

**Plan**

First we determine the overall cell reaction and its standard cell potential, $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$, as in Examples 21-3 and 21-4. Then we apply the Nernst equation to the overall cell.

**Solution**

The $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ half-reaction has the more positive reduction potential, so we write it first. Then we write the $\mathrm{Cl}_{2} / \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$half-reaction as an oxidation, balance the electron transfer, and add the two half-reactions and their potentials to obtain the overall cell reaction and its $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$.

| $2\left(\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 e^{-}\right.$ | $\left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ | $\frac{\boldsymbol{E}^{0}}{+1.507 \mathrm{~V}}$ |
| :---: | ---: | :--- |
| $5\left(2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right.$ | $\left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 e^{-}\right)$ | -1.360 V |
| $2 \mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+16 \mathrm{H}^{+}+10 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ | $\longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+5 \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ | $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+0.147 \mathrm{~V}$ |

In the overall reaction, $n=10$. We then apply the Nernst equation to this overall reaction by substituting appropriate concentration and partial pressure values. Because $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ is a gaseous component, its term in the Nernst equation involves its partial pressure, $P_{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}$, in atm.

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{\text {cell }} & =E_{\text {cell }}^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log \frac{\left[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}\right]^{2}\left(P_{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}\right)^{5}}{\left[\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{16}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{10}} \\
& =0.147 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{10} \log \frac{(0.100)^{2}(0.100)^{5}}{(0.100)^{2}(0.100)^{16}(0.100)^{10}} \\
& =0.147 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{10} \log \left(1.00 \times 10^{21}\right) \\
& =0.147 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{10}(21.00)=0.017 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercises 84 and 90.**

The method illustrated in Example 21-7, applying the Nernst equation to the overall cell reaction, usually involves less calculation than correcting the separate half-reactions as in Example 21-6. We interpret our results as follows: The positive overall cell potentials in Examples 21-6 and 21-7 tell us that each of these cell reactions is spontaneous in the direction written for the concentrations given. If the resulting cell potential were negative, the reverse reaction would be favored at those concentrations. We could then reverse the equation for the overall cell reaction and change the sign of its potential to describe the spontaneous operation of the cell.

# 21-20 Using Electrochemical Cells to Determine Concentrations

In Section 21-19, we used known concentrations to predict cell voltage. We can reverse this reasoning and apply the same ideas to measure the voltage of a cell and then use the Nernst equation to solve for an unknown concentration. The following example illustrates such an application.

> [!example] Example 21-8: Using the Nernst equation to find an unknown concentration
> We construct an electrochemical cell at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as follows. One half-cell is a standard $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} / \mathrm{Zn}$ cell, that is, a strip of zinc immersed in a $1.00 M \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ solution; the other is a nonstandard hydrogen electrode in which a platinum electrode is immersed in a solution of unknown hydrogen ion concentration with gaseous hydrogen bubbling through it at a pressure of 1.000 atm. The observed cell voltage is 0.522 V. (a) Calculate the value of the reaction quotient $Q$. (b) Calculate $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ in the second half-cell. (c) Determine the pH of the solution in the second half-cell.

**Plan**

We saw in Section 21-12 that the zinc-hydrogen cell operated with oxidation at the zinc electrode and reduction at the hydrogen electrode, with a standard cell potential of 0.763 V .

$$
\text { overall: } \quad \mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \quad E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=0.763 \mathrm{~V}
$$

(a) We rearrange the Nernst equation to solve for the reaction quotient, $Q$, from the measured cell voltage with $n=2$. (b) We substitute concentrations and partial pressures in the expression for $Q$. Then we can solve for the only unknown, $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. (c) The pH can be determined from the [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] determined in Part (b).

**Solution**

(a)

$$
E_{\mathrm{cell}}=E_{\mathrm{cell}}^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log Q
$$

Substituting and solving for $Q$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
0.522 \mathrm{~V} & =0.763 \mathrm{~V}-\frac{0.0592}{2} \log Q \\
\frac{0.0592 \mathrm{~V}}{2} \log Q & =(0.763-0.522) \mathrm{V}=0.241 \mathrm{~V} \\
\log Q & =\frac{(2)(0.241 \mathrm{~V})}{0.0592 \mathrm{~V}}=8.14
\end{aligned}
$$

This cell is similar to the zinchydrogen cell that we discussed in Section 21-12, except that the hydrogen concentration is not (necessarily) 1.00 M .

(b) We write the expression for $Q$ from the balanced overall equation, and solve for $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right] P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2}} \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]^{2} } & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\right] P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{Q}=\frac{(1.00)(1.00)}{1.4 \times 10^{8}}=7.1 \times 10^{-9} \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] } & =8.4 \times 10^{-5} M
\end{aligned}
$$

(c)

$$
\mathrm{pH}=-\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=-\log \left(8.4 \times 10^{-5}\right)=4.08
$$

**You should now work Exercises 85 and 86.**

A pH meter contains a voltaic cell, such as that in Example 21-8, that can be used to measure the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$concentration and thus the pH of an unknown solution. It is inconvenient to bubble hydrogen gas at a controlled pressure through a hydrogen electrode, so the routine use of this electrode in many environments is not practical. A typical commercial pH meter (Figure 21-14) incorporates a miniaturized pair of electrodes that are more portable and less fragile. One of these electrodes is a glass electrode, usually consisting of an AgCl -coated silver wire in contact with an HCl solution of known concentration (usually $1.00 M$ ) in a thin-walled glass bulb (Figure 21-14a). A saturated calomel electrode is often used as the second half-cell (reference electrode). This consists of a platinum wire in contact with a paste of liquid mercury and solid mercury(I) chloride, $\mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})$, all immersed in a saturated solution of potassium chloride, KCl . When the glass electrode is placed in a solution, a potential is developed across the thin glass membrane; this potential depends on the [ $\mathrm{H}^{+}$] concentration, and hence on the pH . The overall voltage of this cell thus measures the pH of the solution in contact with the glass electrode. Each change of one pH unit causes a voltage change of 0.0592 volts.

> Figure 21-14 The workings of a commercial pH meter. (a) The glass electrode (left) is a $\mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{s}) / \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$ half-cell immersed in a standard HCl solution that is enclosed by a thin glass membrane. This electrode develops a potential that is sensitive to the external pH relative to that in the internal HCl standard solution. The saturated calomel electrode is the reference electrode. (b) A portable pH meter


The pH meter is designed to measure very small voltages, and its display is calibrated to give a direct readout of the pH of the solution. Meters of this general design have many routine but important applications in medicine, chemistry, biology, agriculture, environmental analysis, and numerous other areas. Glass electrodes can be made small enough to be implanted into blood vessels or even individual living cells.

Electrochemical procedures that use the principles illustrated here provide a convenient method for making many concentration measurements.

## Enrichment Concentration Cells

As we have seen, different concentrations of ions in a half-cell result in different half-cell potentials. We can use this idea to construct a concentration cell, in which both halfcells are composed of the same species, but in different ion concentrations. Suppose we set up such a cell using the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cu}$ half-cell that we introduced in Section 21-9. We put copper electrodes into two aqueous solutions, one that is $0.10 M \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ and another that is $1.00 M \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$. To complete the cell construction, we connect the two electrodes with a wire and join the two solutions with a salt bridge as usual (Figure 21-15). Now the relevant standard reduction half-reaction in either half-cell is

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} \quad E^{0}=+0.337 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Thus the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions in the more concentrated half-cell can be considered as the reactant, and those in the more dilute cell as the product.

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(1.00 M) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(0.10 M)
$$

The overall cell potential can be calculated by applying the Nernst equation to the overall cell reaction. We must first find $E^{0}$, the standard cell potential at standard concentrations; because the same electrode and the same type of ions are involved in both half-cells, this $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ is always zero. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_{\text {cell }} & =E_{\text {cell }}^{0}-\frac{0.0592}{n} \log \frac{[\text { dilute solution }]}{[\text { concentrated solution }]} \\
& =0-\frac{0.0592}{2} \log \frac{0.10}{1.00}=+0.030 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

The overall cell potential is positive; the reaction is spontaneous as written.

## (Enrichment, continued)

As the reaction proceeds, $\left[\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right]$ decreases in the more concentrated half-cell and increases in the more dilute half-cell until the two concentrations are equal; at that point $E_{\text {cell }}=0$, and equilibrium has been reached. This equilibrium $\left[\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}\right]$ is the same concentration that would have been formed if we had just mixed the two solutions directly to obtain a solution of intermediate concentration.

In any concentration cell, the spontaneous reaction is always in the direction that tends to equalize the concentrations.

# 21-21 The Relationship of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ to $\Delta G^{0}$ and $K$

In Section 17-12 we studied the relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\Delta G^{0}$, and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K$.

> [!equation] Gibbs energy and equilibrium constant
> $$
> \Delta G^{0}=-R T \ln K
> $$

There is also a simple relationship between $\Delta G^{0}$ and the standard cell potential, $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$, for a redox reaction (reactants and products in standard states).

> [!equation] Gibbs energy and standard cell potential
> $$
> \Delta G^{0}=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{0}
> $$

$\Delta G^{0}$ can be thought of as the negative of the maximum electrical work that can be obtained from a redox reaction. In this equation, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the overall process ( $\mathrm{mol} e^{-} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}$ ), and $F$ is the faraday, $96,485 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{mol} e^{-}$.

If any one of the three quantities $\Delta G^{0}$, $K$, and $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ is known, the other two can be calculated. Combining the two expressions for $\Delta G^{0}$ gives the direct relationship between $K$ and $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$.

**Plan**

We evaluate the standard cell potential as we have done before. Then we apply the relationship $\Delta G^{0}=-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$.

**Solution**

The standard reduction potential for the $\mathrm{Sn}^{4+} / \mathrm{Sn}^{2+}$ couple is +0.15 volt; that for the $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+} / \mathrm{Cr}$ couple is -0.74 volt. The equation for the reaction shows Cr being oxidized to $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$, so the sign of the $E^{0}$ value for the $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+} / \mathrm{Cr}$ couple is reversed. The overall reaction, the sum of the two half-reactions, has a cell potential equal to the sum of the two halfreaction potentials.

$$
\begin{array}{rr}
\mathrm{Sn}^{4+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Sn}^{2+} & +0.15 \mathrm{~V} \\
\mathrm{Cr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+3 e^{-} & +0.74 \mathrm{~V} \\
\hline 3 \mathrm{Sn}^{4+}+2 \mathrm{Cr} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{Sn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Cr}^{3+} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+0.89 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

The positive value of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ indicates that the forward reaction is spontaneous.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G^{0} & =-n F E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=-\left(\frac{6 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}}\right)\left(\frac{9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}}{\mathrm{~V} \cdot \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}\right)(+0.89 \mathrm{~V}) \\

$$

**You should now work Exercise 101.**

> [!example] Example 21-10: Calculating $K$ from cell potentials

**Plan**

We calculate $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ for the reaction as written. Then we use it to calculate $K$.

**Solution**

First we find the appropriate half-reactions. As the equation is written, Cu is oxidized to $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$, so we write the $\mathrm{Cu}^{+} / \mathrm{Cu}$ couple as an oxidation and reverse the sign of its tabulated $E^{0}$ value. We balance the electron transfer and then add the half-reactions. The resulting $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ value can be used to calculate the equilibrium constant, $K$, for the reaction as written.

$$

\hline 2 \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{PtCl}_{6}^{2-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cu}^{+}+\mathrm{PtCl}_{4}^{2-}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+0.16 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

Then we calculate $K$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln K & =\frac{n F E_{\text {cell }}^{0}}{R T}=\frac{(2)\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{V} \cdot \mathrm{~mol}\right)(+0.16 \mathrm{~V})}{(8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K})(298 \mathrm{~K})}=12.5 \\
K & =e^{12.5}=2.7 \times 10^{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

At equilibrium, $K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Cu}^{+}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{PtCl}_{4}{ }^{2-}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{PtCl}_{6}{ }^{2-}\right]}=2.7 \times 10^{5}$.
The forward reaction is product-favored (spontaneous), and the equilibrium lies far to the right.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> The negative value of $\Delta G^{0}$ tells us that the standard reaction is product-favored (spontaneous), consistent with the positive value of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$. This tells us nothing about how fast the reaction would occur.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> As the problem is stated, we keep the equation as written and accept the corresponding sign of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$. A negative value of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ would lead to $K<1$ for the reaction as written.

We use batteries as portable sources of electrical energy in many ways-in flashlights, cell phones, notebook computers, calculators, automobiles, etc. A battery is a voltaic cell (or a set of voltaic cells coupled together) that has been designed for practical use.

## Primary Voltaic Cells

As any voltaic cell produces current (discharges), chemicals are consumed. Primary voltaic cells cannot be "recharged." Once the chemicals have been consumed, further chemical action is not possible. The electrolytes or electrodes (or both) cannot be regenerated by reversing the current flow through the cell using an external direct current source. The most familiar examples of primary voltaic cells are the ordinary "dry" cells that are used as energy sources in flashlights and other small appliances.

# 21-22 Dry Cells

The first dry cell was patented by Georges Leclanché (1839-1882) in 1866, and such cells are still in common use. The container of the Leclanché cell, made of zinc, also serves as one of the electrodes (Figure 21-16). The other electrode is a carbon rod in the center of the cell. The zinc container is lined with porous paper to separate it from the other materials of the cell. The rest of the cell is filled with a moist mixture (the cell is not really dry) of ammonium chloride ( $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}$ ), manganese(IV) oxide ( $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ ), zinc chloride ( $\mathrm{ZnCl}_{2}$ ), and a porous, inert filler. Dry cells are sealed to keep the moisture from evaporating. As the cell operates (the electrodes must be connected externally), the metallic Zn is oxidized to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, and the liberated electrons flow along the container to the external circuit. Thus, the zinc electrode is the anode (negative electrode).

$$
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The carbon rod is the cathode, at which ammonium ions are reduced.

$$
2 \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \quad \text { (reduction, cathode) }
$$

Addition of the half-reactions gives the overall cell reaction

$$
\mathrm{Zn}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \quad E_{\text {cell }}=1.6 \mathrm{~V}
$$

As $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is formed, it is oxidized by $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ in the cell. This prevents collection of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas on the cathode, which would stop the reaction.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{MnO}(\mathrm{OH})
$$

The mercury battery of the type frequently used in watches, calculators, and hearing aids is a primary cell. Although mercury in the water supply is known to cause health problems, no conclusive evidence has been found that the disposal of household batteries contributes to such problems. Nevertheless, manufacturers are working to decrease the amount of mercury in batteries. In recent years, the amount of mercury in alkaline batteries has decreased markedly; at the same time, the life of such batteries has increased dramatically.

The ammonia produced at the cathode combines with zinc ions and forms a soluble compound containing the complex ions, $\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}$.

$$
\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{NH}_{3} \longrightarrow\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}
$$

The buildup of reaction products at an electrode is called polarization of the electrode.

This reaction reduces polarization due to the buildup of ammonia, and it keeps the concentration of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ from increasing substantially, which would decrease the cell potential by allowing it to diffuse away from the anode. Under heavy current conditions, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ gas can build up in an ordinary dry cell slowing down the migration of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}$ions to the cathode. This can cause a temporary reduction of the battery voltage and current, making it appear as if the battery is prematurely dying. On sitting, however, the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ gas has time to react with the $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions to form $\left[\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{4}\right]^{2+}$, which can diffuse away more readily from the cathode. Thus, a regular battery can often regain full power after sitting for a while after a period of heavy use. Once the reactant chemicals are sufficiently depleted, however, the battery is "dead."

Alkaline dry cells are similar to Leclanché dry cells except that (1) the electrolyte is basic (alkaline) because it contains KOH , and (2) the interior surface of the Zn container is rough; this gives a larger surface area. Alkaline cells have a longer shelf life than ordinary dry cells, and they stand up better under heavy use. Alkaline batteries give considerably better performance because they do not involve the gas production $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ that occurs in a regular $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}$-based dry cell. The voltage of an alkaline cell is about 1.5 volts.

During discharge, the alkaline dry cell reactions are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 e^{-} \\
2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+2 e^{-} & \text {(anode) } \\
\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{OH})(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{sq})+2 \mathrm{MnO}(\mathrm{OH})(\mathrm{s})\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

## Secondary Voltaic Cells

In secondary voltaic cells, or reversible cells, the original reactants can be regenerated. This is done by passing a direct current through the cell in the direction opposite of the discharge current flow. This process is referred to as charging, or recharging, a cell or battery.

> Figure 21-17 (a) A schematic representation of one cell of a lead storage battery. The reactions shown are those taking place during the discharge of the cell. Alternate lead grids are packed with spongy lead and lead(IV) oxide. The grids are immersed in a solution of sulfuric acid, which serves as the electrolyte. To provide a large reacting surface, each cell contains several connected grids, but for clarity only one of each is shown in (a). Such a cell generates a voltage of about 2 volts. Six of these cells are connected together in series, although only three are shown in (b), so that their voltages add to make a 12 -volt battery.


# 21-23 The Lead Storage Battery

The lead storage battery is depicted in Figure 21-17. One group of lead plates contains compressed spongy lead. These alternate with a group of lead plates composed of lead(IV) oxide, $\mathrm{PbO}_{2}$. The electrodes are immersed in a solution of about $40 \%$ sulfuric acid. When the cell discharges, the spongy lead is oxidized to lead ions, and the lead plates accumulate a negative charge.

$$
\mathrm{Pb} \longrightarrow \mathrm{~Pb}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \text {(oxidation) }
$$

The lead ions then react with hydrogen sulfate ions from the sulfuric acid to form insoluble lead(II) sulfate. This begins to coat the lead electrode.

$$
\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+} \quad \text { (precipitation) }
$$

Thus, the net process at the anode during discharge is

$$
\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (anode during discharge) }
$$

The electrons travel through the external circuit and reenter the cell at the $\mathrm{PbO}_{2}$ electrode, which is the cathode during discharge. Here, in the presence of hydrogen ions, the lead(IV) oxide is reduced to lead(II) ions, $\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$. These ions also react with $\mathrm{HSO}_{4}{ }^{-}$ions from the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ to form an insoluble $\mathrm{PbSO}_{4}$ coating on the lead(IV) oxide electrode.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{PbO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (reduction) } \\
\mathrm{Pb}^{2+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{H}^{+} & \text {(precipitation) } \\
\hline \mathrm{PbO}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-}+2 e^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (cathode during discharge) }
\end{array}
$$

The net cell reaction for discharge and its standard potential are obtained by adding the net anode and cathode half-reactions and their tabulated potentials. The tabulated $E^{0}$ value for the anode half-reaction is reversed in sign because it occurs as oxidation during discharge.

The decrease in the concentration of sulfuric acid provides an easy method for measuring the degree of discharge because the density of the solution decreases accordingly.

\[

\]

One cell creates a potential of about 2 volts. Automobile 12 -volt batteries have six cells connected in series. The potential declines only slightly during use, because solid reactants are being consumed. As the cell is used, some $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is consumed, lowering its concentration.

When a potential slightly greater than the potential the battery can generate is imposed across the electrodes, the current flow can be reversed. The battery can then be recharged by reversing all the reactions. The alternator or generator applies this potential when the engine is in operation. The reactions that occur in a lead storage battery are summarized as follows.

$$
\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{PbO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 \mathrm{HSO}_{4}^{-} \xlongequal[\text { charge }]{\text { discharge }} 2 \mathrm{PbSO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

During many repeated charge-discharge cycles, some of the $\mathrm{PbSO}_{4}$ falls to the bottom of the container and the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentration becomes correspondingly low. Eventually the battery cannot be recharged fully. It can be traded in for a new one, and the lead can be recovered and reused to make new batteries. This is one of the oldest and most successful examples of recycling.

# 21-24 The Nickel-Cadmium (Nicad) Cell

The nickel-cadmium (nicad) cell has gained widespread popularity because it can be recharged. It thus has a much longer useful life than ordinary (Leclanché) dry cells. Nicad batteries are used in electronic toys, camcorders, and photographic equipment.

When the battery is delivering power the anode is cadmium, and the cathode is nickel(IV) oxide. The electrolytic solution is basic. The "discharge" reactions that occur in a nicad battery are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 e^{-} \\
\mathrm{NiO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+2 e^{-} & \text {(anode) } \\
\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{NiO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cd}\left(\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})\right. \\
\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s}) & \text { (cathode) }
\end{aligned}
$$

The solid reaction product at each electrode adheres to the electrode surface. Hence, a nicad battery can be recharged by an external source of electricity; that is, the electrode reactions can be reversed. Because no gases are produced by the reactions in a nicad battery, the unit can be sealed. The voltage of a nicad cell is about 1.4 volts, slightly less than that of a Leclanché cell. The toxicity of cadmium and the limited number of recharges that a nicad battery can handle before deactivating are problems that newer battery technologies are addressing. Nickel-metal-hydride ( NiMH ) and lithium-ion batteries are two newer generation cells that are environmentally friendlier, have longer lifetimes, and higher power-to-weight ratios.

# 21-25 The Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cell

Fuel cells are voltaic cells in which the reactants are continuously supplied to the cell and the products are continuously removed. The hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell (Figure 21-18) already has many applications. It is used in spacecraft to supplement the energy obtained from solar cells. Liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is carried on board as a propellant. The boiled-off $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ vapor that ordinarily would be lost is used in a fuel cell to generate electrical power.

Hydrogen (the fuel) is supplied to the anode compartment. Oxygen is fed into the cathode compartment. The diffusion rates of the gases into the cell are carefully regulated for maximum efficiency. Oxygen is reduced at the cathode, which consists of porous carbon impregnated with a finely divided Pt or Pd catalyst.

$$
\mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \xrightarrow{\text { catalyst }} 4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \quad \text { (cathode) }
$$

The $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions migrate through the electrolyte to the anode, an aqueous solution of a base. The anode is also porous carbon containing a small amount of catalyst ( $\mathrm{Pt}, \mathrm{Ag}$, or CoO ). Here $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is oxidized to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

A generator supplies direct current (dc). An alternator supplies alternating current (ac), so an electronic rectifier is used to convert this to direct current for the battery.

Rechargeable nicad batteries are used to operate many electrical devices.

To see why a nicad battery produces a constant voltage, write the Nernst equation for its reaction. Look at $Q$.

The efficiency of energy conversion of the fuel cell operation is $60-70 \%$ of the theoretical maximum (based on $\Delta G$ ). This represents about twice the efficiency that can be realized from burning hydrogen in a heat engine coupled to a generator.

Nickel-metal-hydride battery technology is used in hybrid gas-electric vehicles such as the Ford Escape Hybrid. The NiMH batteries (330-volt) are used to power the electric drive motor in the transmission. The batteries are

> Figure 21-18 (a) The chemistry of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. (b) Space shuttle fuel cells are self-contained units, each measuring $14 \times 15 \times 45 \mathrm{in}$. and weighing 260 lb . Three of these are installed under the payload bay, just aft of the crew compartment, and are fueled by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from cryogenic tanks. Each fuel cell is capable of providing 12 kW continuously, and up to 16 kW for short periods. A single unit can fully power the entire space shuttle in its day-to-day operation. The water produced is used for crew drinking and spacecraft cooling.


The net reaction is obtained from the two half-reactions.

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \longrightarrow 4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} & \text {(cathode) } \\
2\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e^{-}\right) & \text {(anode) } \\
\hline 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (net cell reaction) }
\end{array}
$$

Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at an illuminated photoelectrode. Light from the sun may soon be used to produce hydrogen, the ultimate clean-burning fuel.

The net reaction is the same as the burning of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, but combustion does not actually occur. Most of the chemical energy from the formation of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds is converted directly into electrical energy, rather than into heat energy as in combustion.

When the $\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ fuel cell is used aboard spacecraft, it is operated at a high enough temperature that the water evaporates at the same rate as it is produced. The vapor is then condensed to pure water.

Current research is aimed at modifying the design of fuel cells to lower their cost. Better catalysts would speed the reactions to allow more rapid generation of electricity and produce more power per unit volume. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ cell is nonpolluting; the only substance released is $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Catalysts have been developed that allow sunlight to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, which might be used to operate fuel cells, permitting the utilization of solar energy.

Fuel cells have also been constructed using fuels other than hydrogen, such as methane or methanol. Biomedical researchers envision the possibility of using tiny fuel cells to operate pacemakers. The disadvantage of other power supplies for pacemakers, which are primary voltaic cells, is that their reactants are eventually consumed so that they require periodic surgical replacement. As long as the fuel and oxidizer are supplied, a fuel cell can-in theory, at least-operate forever. Eventually, tiny pacemaker fuel cells might be operated by the oxidation of blood sugar (the fuel) by the body's oxygen at a metal electrode implanted just below the skin.

Electrochemistry deals with the chemical changes produced by electric current and with the production of electricity by chemical reactions. Many metals are purified or are plated onto jewelry by electrochemical methods. Digital watches, automobile starters, calculators, and pacemakers are just a few devices that depend on electrochemically produced power. Corrosion of metals is also an electrochemical process.

We learn much about chemical reactions from the study of electrochemistry. The amount of electrical energy consumed or produced can be measured quite accurately. All electrochemical reactions involve the transfer of electrons and are therefore oxidationreduction reactions. The sites of oxidation and reduction are separated physically so that oxidation occurs at one location, and reduction occurs at the other. Electrochemical processes require some method of introducing a stream of electrons into a reacting chemical system and some means of withdrawing electrons. In most applications the reacting system is contained in a cell, and an electric current enters or exits by electrodes.

We classify electrochemical cells into two types.

1. Electrolytic cells are those in which electrical energy from an external source causes nonspontaneous chemical reactions to occur.
2. Voltaic cells are those in which spontaneous chemical reactions produce electricity and supply it to an external circuit.

> Figure 21-1 The motion of ions through a solution is an electric current. This accounts for ionic (electrolytic) conduction. Positively charged ions migrate toward the negative electrode, and negatively charged ions migrate toward the positive electrode. Here the rate of migration is greatly exaggerated for clarity. The ionic velocities are actually only slightly greater than random molecular speeds.


We will discuss several kinds of electrochemical cells. From experimental observations we deduce what is happening at each electrode and for the overall reaction chemistry. We then construct simplified diagrams of the cells.
