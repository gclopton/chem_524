# 21-25 The Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cell

Fuel cells are voltaic cells in which the reactants are continuously supplied to the cell and the products are continuously removed. The hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell (Figure 21-18) already has many applications. It is used in spacecraft to supplement the energy obtained from solar cells. Liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is carried on board as a propellant. The boiled-off $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ vapor that ordinarily would be lost is used in a fuel cell to generate electrical power.

Hydrogen (the fuel) is supplied to the anode compartment. Oxygen is fed into the cathode compartment. The diffusion rates of the gases into the cell are carefully regulated for maximum efficiency. Oxygen is reduced at the cathode, which consists of porous carbon impregnated with a finely divided Pt or Pd catalyst.

$$
\mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \xrightarrow{\text { catalyst }} 4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \quad \text { (cathode) }
$$

The $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions migrate through the electrolyte to the anode, an aqueous solution of a base. The anode is also porous carbon containing a small amount of catalyst ( $\mathrm{Pt}, \mathrm{Ag}$, or CoO ). Here $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is oxidized to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

A generator supplies direct current (dc). An alternator supplies alternating current (ac), so an electronic rectifier is used to convert this to direct current for the battery.

Rechargeable nicad batteries are used to operate many electrical devices.

To see why a nicad battery produces a constant voltage, write the Nernst equation for its reaction. Look at $Q$.

The efficiency of energy conversion of the fuel cell operation is $60-70 \%$ of the theoretical maximum (based on $\Delta G$ ). This represents about twice the efficiency that can be realized from burning hydrogen in a heat engine coupled to a generator.

Nickel-metal-hydride battery technology is used in hybrid gas-electric vehicles such as the Ford Escape Hybrid. The NiMH batteries (330-volt) are used to power the electric drive motor in the transmission. The batteries are

> Figure 21-18 (a) The chemistry of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. (b) Space shuttle fuel cells are self-contained units, each measuring $14 \times 15 \times 45 \mathrm{in}$. and weighing 260 lb . Three of these are installed under the payload bay, just aft of the crew compartment, and are fueled by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from cryogenic tanks. Each fuel cell is capable of providing 12 kW continuously, and up to 16 kW for short periods. A single unit can fully power the entire space shuttle in its day-to-day operation. The water produced is used for crew drinking and spacecraft cooling.


The net reaction is obtained from the two half-reactions.

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \longrightarrow 4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} & \text {(cathode) } \\
2\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e^{-}\right) & \text {(anode) } \\
\hline 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (net cell reaction) }
\end{array}

Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at an illuminated photoelectrode. Light from the sun may soon be used to produce hydrogen, the ultimate clean-burning fuel.

The net reaction is the same as the burning of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, but combustion does not actually occur. Most of the chemical energy from the formation of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds is converted directly into electrical energy, rather than into heat energy as in combustion.

When the $\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ fuel cell is used aboard spacecraft, it is operated at a high enough temperature that the water evaporates at the same rate as it is produced. The vapor is then condensed to pure water.

Current research is aimed at modifying the design of fuel cells to lower their cost. Better catalysts would speed the reactions to allow more rapid generation of electricity and produce more power per unit volume. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} / \mathrm{O}_{2}$ cell is nonpolluting; the only substance released is $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Catalysts have been developed that allow sunlight to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, which might be used to operate fuel cells, permitting the utilization of solar energy.

Fuel cells have also been constructed using fuels other than hydrogen, such as methane or methanol. Biomedical researchers envision the possibility of using tiny fuel cells to operate pacemakers. The disadvantage of other power supplies for pacemakers, which are primary voltaic cells, is that their reactants are eventually consumed so that they require periodic surgical replacement. As long as the fuel and oxidizer are supplied, a fuel cell can-in theory, at least-operate forever. Eventually, tiny pacemaker fuel cells might be operated by the oxidation of blood sugar (the fuel) by the body's oxygen at a metal electrode implanted just below the skin.
