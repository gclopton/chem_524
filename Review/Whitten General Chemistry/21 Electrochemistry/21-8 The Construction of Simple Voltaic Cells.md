# 21-8 The Construction of Simple Voltaic Cells

A half-cell contains the oxidized and reduced forms of an element, or other more complex species, in contact with one another. A common kind of half-cell consists of a piece of metal (the electrode) immersed in a solution of its ions. Consider two such half-cells in separate beakers (Figure 21-6). The electrodes are connected by a wire. A voltmeter can be inserted into the circuit to measure the potential difference between the two electrodes, or an ammeter can be inserted to measure the current flow. The electric current is the result of the spontaneous redox reaction that occurs. We measure the potential of the cell.

The circuit between the two solutions is completed by a salt bridge. This can be any medium through which ions can slowly pass. A salt bridge can be made by bending a piece of glass tubing into the shape of a "U," filling it with a hot saturated salt $/ 5 \%$ agar solution, and allowing it to cool. The cooled mixture "sets" to the consistency of firm gelatin. As a result, the solution does not run out when the tube is inverted (Figure 21-6), but the ions in the gel are still able to move. A salt bridge serves three functions.

1. It allows electrical contact between the two solutions.
2. It prevents mixing of the electrode solutions.
3. It maintains the electrical neutrality in each half-cell as ions flow into and out of the salt bridge.

A cell in which all reactants and products are in their thermodynamic standard states ( $1 M$ for dissolved species and 1 atm partial pressure for gases) is called a standard cell.

Anodized aluminum is made by oxidizing a piece of aluminum in an electrolytic cell for a short period of time. The oxidation microscopically dissolves some of the AI surface and coats it with a protective and tough coating of aluminum oxide. This creates a matte finish that can be dyed different colors.

These cells are named for Allesandro Volta (1745-1827) and Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), two Italian physicists of the 18th century.

Neither a voltmeter nor an ammeter generates electrical energy. They are designed to measure electrical voltage or the amount of current flow.

Agar is a porous, gelatinous material obtained from algae.

When we show a concentration in a standard cell as $1 M$, it is assumed to be exactly $1 M$.

## A Spectacular View of One Mole of Electrons

Early in our study of chemistry, we saw that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. We also discussed the incredibly large size of Avogadro's number, $6.022 \times 10^{23}$. Although individual atoms and molecules are invisible to the naked eye, one mole of atoms or molecules is easily detected. Because subatomic particles are even smaller than atoms and also invisible, you might never expect to see individual electrons. Let's consider the possibility, however, of seeing a faraday of charge. A faraday of charge contains Avogadro's number of electrons. Would this collection of $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ electrons be visible? If so, what might it look like? It would look quite spectacular!

Throughout the 1980s, scientists carefully studied data collected during 5 million lightning flashes along the eastern United States. The data were collected by 36 instruments that were collectively known as the National Lightning Detection Network. The investigating scientists found that the electrical currents in lightning flashes over northern Florida measured about $45,000 \mathrm{amps}$, about double the $25,000-\mathrm{amp}$ currents in lightning flashes over the New England states. This study showed that the amount of current flowing during lightning flashes was inversely proportional to the latitude (distance from the equator) of the storm.

One coulomb is the amount of charge that passes a point when a one-ampere current flows for one second ( 1 coulomb $=$ 1 ampere ⋅ second). Thus, a current of $96,500 \mathrm{amps}$ flowing for one second contains Avogadro's number of electrons, or one faraday of charge.

Measurements taken in northern Florida show that a typical two-second lightning strike over that section of the country would transfer approximately Avogadro's number of electrons between the clouds and the earth. So, for those living in northern Florida, a spectacular mental view of one mole of electrons can be obtained by visualizing a two-second lightning strike. Keep in mind that the average lightning strike lasts only a small fraction of a second, and that we can only have a mental view of a two-second lightning strike by extrapolation of what is seen in nature. Because New England lightning strikes produce only about half the current of lightning strikes over northern Florida, people in New England must try to imagine a four-second lightning strike.
