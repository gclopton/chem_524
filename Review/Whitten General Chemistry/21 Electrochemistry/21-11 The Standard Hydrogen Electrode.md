# 21-11 The Standard Hydrogen Electrode

Every oxidation must be accompanied by a reduction (i.e., the electrons must have somewhere to go). So it is impossible to determine experimentally the potential of any single electrode. We therefore establish an arbitrary standard. The conventional reference electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This electrode contains a piece of metal electrolytically coated with a grainy black surface of inert platinum metal, immersed in a $1 M \mathrm{H}^{+}$ solution. Hydrogen, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, is bubbled at 1 atm pressure through a glass envelope over the platinized electrode (Figure 21-8).

By international convention, the standard hydrogen electrode is arbitrarily assigned a

| SHE Half-Reaction | $\boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}}$ (standard electrode potential) |  |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-}$ | exactly $0.0000 \ldots \mathrm{~V}$ | (SHE as anode) |
| $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}$ | exactly $0.0000 \ldots \mathrm{~V}$ | (SHE as cathode) |

As we shall see in Section 21-14, this arbitrary definition will provide a basis on which to describe the relative potential (and hence the relative spontaneity) of any half-cell process. We can construct a standard cell consisting of a standard hydrogen electrode and some other standard electrode (half-cell). Because the defined electrode potential of the SHE contributes exactly 0 volts to the sum, the voltage of the overall cell is then attributed entirely to the other half-cell.
