# 21-3 The Electrolysis of Molten Sodium Chloride (The Downs Cell)

Solid sodium chloride does not conduct electricity. Its ions vibrate about fixed positions, but they are not free to move throughout the crystal. Molten (melted) NaCl , however, is an excellent conductor because its ions are freely mobile. Consider a cell in which a source of direct current is connected by wires to two inert graphite electrodes

Molten NaCl, melting point $801^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, is a clear, colorless liquid that looks like water.

The Na metal remains liquid because its melting point is only $97.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It floats because it is less dense than the molten NaCl . (Figure 21-2a). They are immersed in a container of molten sodium chloride. When the current flows, we observe the following.

1. A pale green gas, which is chlorine, $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, is liberated at one electrode.
2. Molten, silvery-white metallic sodium, Na , forms at the other electrode and floats on top of the molten sodium chloride.
From these observations we can deduce the processes of the cell. Chlorine must be produced by oxidation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions, and the electrode at which this happens must be the anode. Metallic sodium is produced by reduction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions at the cathode, where electrons are being forced into the cell.

In this chapter, as in Chapters 6 and 11, we often use red type to emphasize reduction and blue type to emphasize oxidation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 e^{-} \\
\frac{2\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}+e^{-}\right.}{2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}} & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}(\ell)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The formation of metallic Na and gaseous $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ from NaCl is nonspontaneous except at temperatures very much higher than $801^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The direct current (dc) source must supply electrical energy to force this reaction to occur. Electrons are used in the cathode halfreaction (reduction) and produced in the anode half-reaction (oxidation). They therefore

The direction of spontaneous flow for negatively charged particles is from negative to positive.

We will omit the notation that indicates states of substances-(s), ( $\ell$ ), (g), and (aq)-except where states are not obvious. This is a common shortcut when writing equations.

Not surprisingly, the fluctuations in commercial prices of these widely used industrial products- $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, and NaOH -have often paralleled one another.
travel through the wire from anode to cathode. The dc source forces electrons to flow nonspontaneously from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. The anode is the positive electrode and the cathode the negative electrode in all electrolytic cells. Figure 21-2a is a simplified diagram of the cell.

Sodium and chlorine must not be allowed to come in contact with each other because they react spontaneously, rapidly, and explosively to form sodium chloride. Figure 21-2b shows the Downs cell that is used for the industrial electrolysis of sodium chloride. The Downs cell is expensive to run, mainly because of the cost of construction, the cost of the electricity, and the cost of heating the NaCl to melt it. Nevertheless, electrolysis of a molten sodium salt is the most practical means by which metallic Na can be obtained, owing to its extremely high reactivity. Once liberated by the electrolysis, the liquid Na metal is drained off, cooled, and cast into blocks. These must be stored in an inert environment (e.g., in mineral oil) to prevent reaction with atmospheric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or water.

Electrolysis of NaCl in the Downs cell is the main commercial method of producing metallic sodium. The $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gas produced in the Downs cell is cooled, compressed, and marketed. This partially offsets the expense of producing metallic sodium, but most chlorine is produced by the cheaper electrolysis of aqueous NaCl .
