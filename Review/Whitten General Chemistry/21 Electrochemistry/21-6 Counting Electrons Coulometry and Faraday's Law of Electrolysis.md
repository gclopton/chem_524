# 21-6 Counting Electrons: Coulometry and Faraday's Law of Electrolysis

In 1832-1833, Michael Faraday's studies of electrolysis led to this conclusion.

> The amount of substance that undergoes oxidation or reduction at each electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the amount of electricity that passes through the cell.

This is Faraday's Law of Electrolysis. A quantitative unit of electricity is now called the faraday.

One faraday is the amount of electricity that corresponds to the gain or loss, and therefore the passage, of $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ electrons, or one mole of electrons.

A smaller electrical unit commonly used in chemistry, physics, and electronics is the coulomb (C). One coulomb is defined as the amount of charge that passes a given point when 1 ampere (A) of electric current flows for 1 second. One ampere of current equals 1 coulomb per second. One faraday is equal to 96,485 coulombs of charge.

Table 21-1 shows the amounts of several elements produced during electrolysis by the passage of 1 faraday of electricity. The use of electrochemical cells to relate the amount of reactant or product to the amount of current passed is called coulometry.

Michael Faraday (1791-1867) is considered the greatest experimental scientist of the 19th century. As a bookbinder's apprentice, he educated himself by extensive reading. Intrigued by his self-study of chemistry and by a lecture given by Sir Humphry Davy, the leading chemist of the day, Faraday applied for a position with Davy at the Royal Institution. He subsequently became director of that laboratory. His public lectures on science were very popular.

> [!example] Example 21-1: Electrolysis
> Calculate the mass of copper metal produced at the cathode during the passage of 2.50 amperes of current through a solution of copper(II) sulfate for 50.0 minutes.

**Plan**

The half-reaction that describes the reduction of copper(II) ions tells us the number of moles of electrons required to produce one mole of copper metal. Each mole of electrons corresponds to 1 faraday, or $9.65 \times 10^{4}$ coulombs, of charge. The product of current and time gives the number of coulombs.

**Solution**

The equation for the reduction of copper(II) ions to copper metal is

| $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ | + | $2 e^{-}$ | Cu | (reduction, cathode) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| 1 mol | $2\left(6.02 \times 10^{23}\right) e^{-}$ |  | 1 mol |  |
| 63.5 g | $2\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)$ |  | 63.5 g |  |

We see that 63.5 grams of copper "plate out" for every 2 moles of electrons, or for every $2\left(9.65 \times 10^{4}\right.$ coulombs) of charge. We first calculate the number of coulombs passing through the cell.

$$
? \mathrm{C}=50.0 \mathrm{~min} \times \frac{60 \mathrm{~s}}{1 \mathrm{~min}} \times \frac{2.50 \mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~s}}=7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C}
$$

We calculate the mass of copper produced by the passage of $7.50 \times 10^{3}$ coulombs.

$$
2 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu}=7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}{9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}} \times \frac{63.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu}}{2 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}=2.47 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Cu} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { (about the mass } \\
& \text { of a copper penny) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice how little copper is deposited by this considerable current in 50 minutes.

**You should now work Exercises 26 and 32.**

> [!example] Example 21-2: Electrolysis
> What volume of oxygen gas (measured at STP) is produced by the oxidation of water at the anode in the electrolysis of copper(II) sulfate in Example 21-1?

The amount of electricity in Examples 21-1 and 21-2 would be sufficient to light a 100-watt household light bulb for about 150 minutes, or 2.5 hours.

When the number of significant figures in the calculation warrants, the value 96,485 coulombs is usually rounded to 96,500 coulombs $\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> Remember that $2.50\,\mathrm{A}=2.50\,\mathrm{C}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Also remember to convert time into seconds when doing these calculations.

A family memento that has been electroplated with copper. To aid in electroplating onto nonconductors, such as shoes, the material is first soaked in a concentrated electrolyte solution to make it conductive.

**Plan**

We use the same approach as in Example 21-1. Here we relate the amount of charge passed to the number of moles, and hence the volume of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas produced at STP.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { current } \\
\times \text { time }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\text { no. of } \\
\text { coulombs }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\text { mol of } e^{-} \\
\text {passed }
\end{gathered} \longrightarrow \begin{gathered}
\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \\
\text { of } \mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Solution**

The equation for the oxidation of water and the equivalence between the number of coulombs and the volume of oxygen produced at STP are

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \underset{\substack{1 \mathrm{~mol} \\ 22.4 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}}}}{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+4 \mathrm{H}^{+}+\underset{\substack{4\left(6.02 \times 10^{23}\right) e^{-} \\ 4\left(9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}\right)}}{4 e^{-}} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The number of coulombs passing through the cell is $7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C}$. For every $4\left(9.65 \times 10^{4}\right.$ coulombs) passing through the cell, one mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(22.4 \mathrm{~L}$ at STP) is produced.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underline{?} \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2} & =7.50 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}}{9.65 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{C}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{4 \mathrm{~mol} e^{-}} \times \frac{22.4 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}} \\
& =0.435 \mathrm{~L}_{\mathrm{STP}} \mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 28.**

Notice how little product is formed by what seems to be a lot of electricity. This suggests why electrolytic production of gases and metals is so costly.
