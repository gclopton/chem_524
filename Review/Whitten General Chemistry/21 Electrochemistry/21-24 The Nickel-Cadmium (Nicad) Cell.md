# 21-24 The Nickel-Cadmium (Nicad) Cell

The nickel-cadmium (nicad) cell has gained widespread popularity because it can be recharged. It thus has a much longer useful life than ordinary (Leclanché) dry cells. Nicad batteries are used in electronic toys, camcorders, and photographic equipment.

When the battery is delivering power the anode is cadmium, and the cathode is nickel(IV) oxide. The electrolytic solution is basic. The "discharge" reactions that occur in a nicad battery are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 e^{-} \\
\mathrm{NiO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+2 e^{-} & \text {(anode) } \\
\mathrm{Cd}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{NiO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cd}\left(\mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}(\mathrm{aq})\right. \\
\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s}) & \text { (cathode) }
\end{aligned}
$$

The solid reaction product at each electrode adheres to the electrode surface. Hence, a nicad battery can be recharged by an external source of electricity; that is, the electrode reactions can be reversed. Because no gases are produced by the reactions in a nicad battery, the unit can be sealed. The voltage of a nicad cell is about 1.4 volts, slightly less than that of a Leclanché cell. The toxicity of cadmium and the limited number of recharges that a nicad battery can handle before deactivating are problems that newer battery technologies are addressing. Nickel-metal-hydride ( NiMH ) and lithium-ion batteries are two newer generation cells that are environmentally friendlier, have longer lifetimes, and higher power-to-weight ratios.
