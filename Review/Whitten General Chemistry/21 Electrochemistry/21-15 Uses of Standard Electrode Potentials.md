# 21-15 Uses of Standard Electrode Potentials

The most important application of electrode potentials is the prediction of the spontaneity of redox reactions. Standard electrode potentials can be used to determine the spontaneity of redox reactions in general, whether or not the reactions can take place in electrochemical cells.

Suppose we ask the question: At standard conditions, will $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions oxidize metallic Zn to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions, or will $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions oxidize metallic copper to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ? One of the two possible reactions is spontaneous, and the reverse reaction is nonspontaneous. We must determine which one is spontaneous. We already know the answer to this question from experimental results (Section 21-9), but let us demonstrate the procedure for predicting the spontaneous reaction from known values of standard electrode potentials.

1. Choose the appropriate half-reactions from a table of standard reduction potentials.
2. Write the equation for the half-reaction with the more positive (or less negative) $E^{0}$ value for reduction, along with its potential.
3. Write the equation for the other half-reaction as an oxidation and write its oxidation potential; to do this, reverse the tabulated reduction half-reaction and change the sign of $E^{0}$. (Reversing a half-reaction or a complete reaction also changes the sign of its potential.)

4. Balance the electron transfer. We do not multiply the potentials by the numbers used to balance the electron transfer! The reason is that each potential represents a tendency for a reaction process to occur relative to the SHE; this does not depend on how many times it occurs. An electric potential is an intensive property.
5. Add the reduction and oxidation half-reactions, and add the reduction and oxidation potentials. $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ will be positive for the resulting overall cell reaction. This indicates that the reaction as written is product-favored (spontaneous). A negative $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ value would indicate that the reaction is reactant-favored (nonspontaneous).

> $$
> E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=E_{\text {cathode }}^{0}-E_{\text {anode }}^{0}
> $$

For the cell described here, the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} / \mathrm{Cu}$ couple has the more positive reduction potential, so we keep it as the reduction half-reaction and reverse the other half-reaction. Following the steps outlined, we obtain the equation for the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu} & +0.337 \mathrm{~V} \longleftarrow \text { reduction potential } \\
\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & +0.763 \mathrm{~V} \longleftarrow \text { oxidation potential } \\
\hline \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Zn} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+1.100 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

The positive $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ value tells us that the forward reaction is spontaneous (product-favored) at standard conditions. So we conclude that copper(II) ions oxidize metallic zinc to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions as they are reduced to metallic copper. (Section 21-9 shows that the potential of the standard zinc-copper voltaic cell is 1.100 volts. This is the spontaneous reaction that occurs.)

> [!note] Stop and Think
> It is important to change the sign of $E^{0}$ whenever you reverse a half-reaction, but **do not** multiply $E^{0}$ values by the factors used to balance electrons. Electric potential is an intensive property.

Platinum metal is often used as the inert electrode material. These two standard half-cells could be shown in shorthand notation as
$\mathrm{Pt} \mid \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}(1 M), \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}(1 M) \quad$ and $\mathrm{Pt} \mid \mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}{ }^{2-}(1 \mathrm{M}), \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}(1 \mathrm{M})$

> [!note] Stop and Think
> If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ appears in a half-reaction, the solution is acidic. If $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ appears, the solution is basic.

The reverse reaction has a negative $E^{0}$ and is nonspontaneous.
nonspontaneous
reaction:

$$
\mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{Zn}^{2+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+\mathrm{Zn} \quad E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=-1.100 \text { volts }
$$

To make it occur, we would have to supply electrical energy with a potential difference greater than 1.100 volts. That is, this nonspontaneous reaction would have to be carried out in an electrolytic cell.

> [!example] Example 21-3: Predicting the direction of a redox reaction
> At standard conditions, will chromium(III) ions, $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$, oxidize metallic copper to copper(II) ions, $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, or will $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ oxidize metallic chromium to $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ions? Write the equation for the spontaneous (product-favored) reaction and calculate $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ for this reaction.

**Plan**

We refer to the table of standard reduction potentials and choose the two appropriate half-reactions.

**Solution**

The copper half-reaction has the more positive reduction potential, so we write it first. Then we write the chromium half-reaction as an oxidation, balance the electron transfer, and add the two half-reactions and their potentials.

$$
\begin{array}{rr} 
& \\
\cline { 3 - 3 } 3\left(\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\right) & \boldsymbol{E}^{\mathbf{0}} \\
2\left(\mathrm{Cr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+3 e^{-}\right) & (\text {reduction }) \\
\cline { 3 - 3 }(\text { oxidation }) & +0.337 \mathrm{~V} \\
\hline 2 \mathrm{Cr}+3 \mathrm{Cu}^{2+} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cr}^{3+}+3 \mathrm{Cu} & E_{\text {cell }}^{0}=+1.08 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}
$$

Because $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ is positive, we know that the reaction is product-favored (spontaneous).
$\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions spontaneously oxidize metallic Cr to $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$ ions and are reduced to metallic Cu .

**You should now work Exercise 58a.**

> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: The sign of $E_{\text{cell}}^{0}$ indicates spontaneity
> For a reaction that is spontaneous at standard conditions, $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ must be positive. A negative value of $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ indicates that the reverse of the reaction written would be spontaneous at standard conditions.
