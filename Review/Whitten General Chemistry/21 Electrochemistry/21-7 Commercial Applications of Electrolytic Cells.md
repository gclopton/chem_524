# 21-7 Commercial Applications of Electrolytic Cells

Several elements are produced commercially by electrolysis. In Sections 21-3 to 21-5, we described some electrolytic cells that produce sodium (the Downs cell), chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen. Electrolysis of molten compounds is also the common method of obtaining other Group 1A metals, 2A metals (except barium), and aluminum (Section 22-3). Impure metals can also be refined electrolytically, as we will describe for copper in Section 22-8.

Metal-plated articles are common in our society. Jewelry and tableware are often plated with silver. Gold is plated onto jewelry and electrical contacts. Copper is plated onto many objects for decorative purposes (Figure 21-5). Automobiles formerly had steel bumpers plated with thin films of chromium. A chrome bumper required approximately 3 seconds of electroplating to produce a smooth, shiny surface only 0.0002 mm thick. When the metal atoms are deposited too rapidly, they are not able to form extended lattices. Rapid plating of metal results in rough, grainy, black surfaces. Slower plating produces smooth surfaces. "Tin cans" are steel cans plated electrolytically with tin; these are sometimes replaced by cans plated in a fraction of a second with an extremely thin chromium film.

## I Voltaic or Galvanic Cells

Voltaic, or galvanic, cells are electrochemical cells in which spontaneous (product-favored) oxidation-reduction reactions produce electrical energy. The two halves of the redox reaction are separated, requiring electron transfer to occur through an external circuit. In this way, useful electrical energy is obtained. Everyone is familiar with some voltaic cells. The batteries commonly used in flashlights, portable radios, photographic equipment, and many toys and appliances are voltaic cells. Automobile batteries consist of voltaic cells connected in series so that their voltages add. We will first consider some simple laboratory cells used to measure the potential difference, or voltage, of a reaction under study. We will then look at some common voltaic cells.
