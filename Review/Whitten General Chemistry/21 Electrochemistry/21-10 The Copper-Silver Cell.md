# 21-10 The Copper-Silver Cell

Now consider a similar standard voltaic cell consisting of a strip of Cu immersed in $1 M \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ solution and a strip of Ag immersed in $1 M \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution. A wire and a salt bridge complete the circuit. The following observations have been made.

1. The initial voltage of the cell is 0.462 volt.
2. The mass of the copper electrode decreases. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion concentration increases in the solution around the copper electrode.
3. The mass of the silver electrode increases. The $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ion concentration decreases in the solution around the silver electrode.

In this cell the Cu electrode is the anode because Cu metal is oxidized to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions. The Ag electrode is the cathode because $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions are reduced to metallic Ag (Figure 21-7).

$$
\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{~s})
$$

The standard potential of this cell is 0.462 volt. This standard cell can be represented as $\mathrm{Cu}\left|\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(1 M) \| \mathrm{Ag}^{+}(1 M)\right| \mathrm{Ag}$.

$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\mathrm{Cu} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} & \text {(oxidation, anode) } \\
2\left(\mathrm{Ag}^{+}+e^{-}\right. & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ag}) & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\
\hline \mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+} & \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag} & \text { (overall cell reaction) }
\end{array}
$$

KCl is not used in this salt bridge because the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions would react with $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions to form insoluble $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$.

As before, ions from the salt bridge migrate to maintain electroneutrality. Some $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ions (from the cathode vessel) and some $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions (from the anode vessel) also migrate into the salt bridge.

Recall that in the zinc-copper cell the copper electrode was the cathode; now in the copper-silver cell the copper electrode has become the anode.

Whether a particular electrode acts as an anode or a cathode in a voltaic cell depends on what the other electrode of the cell is.

The two cells we have described show that the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion is more easily reduced (is a stronger oxidizing agent) than $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, so $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ oxidizes metallic zinc to $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$. By contrast, the $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ion is more easily reduced (is a stronger oxidizing agent) than $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, so $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$oxidizes Cu atoms to $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$. Conversely, metallic Zn is a stronger reducing agent than metallic Cu , and metallic Cu is a stronger reducing agent than metallic Ag . We can now arrange the species we have studied in order of increasing strength as oxidizing agents and as reducing agents.

Results such as these form the basis for the activity series (Table 4-14).

A spiral of copper wire is placed in a colorless solution of silver nitrate, $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$. The silver is gradually displaced from solution and adheres to the wire. The resulting copper nitrate solution is blue.

$$
2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}
$$

The same spontaneous (product-favored) reaction occurs when the two half-reactions are separated in the copper-silver cell (Figure 21-7).

No reaction occurs when silver wire is placed in a blue copper sulfate solution. The reaction

$$
\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 \mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{Ag}^{+}
$$

is the reverse of the spontaneous reaction shown here and in Figure 21-7; it has a negative $E_{\text {cell }}^{0}$ and is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored).

## Standard Electrode Potentials

The potentials of the standard zinc-copper and copper-silver voltaic cells are 1.100 volts and 0.462 volt, respectively. The magnitude of a cell's potential measures the spontaneity of its redox reaction. Higher (more positive) cell potentials indicate greater driving force for the reaction as written. Under standard conditions, the oxidation of metallic Zn by $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions has a greater tendency to go toward completion than does the oxidation of metallic Cu by $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ions. It is convenient to separate the total cell potential into the individual contributions of the two half-reactions. This lets us determine the relative tendencies of particular oxidation or reduction half-reactions to occur. Such information gives us a quantitative basis for specifying strengths of oxidizing and reducing agents. In the next several sections, we shall see how this is done for standard half-cells.
