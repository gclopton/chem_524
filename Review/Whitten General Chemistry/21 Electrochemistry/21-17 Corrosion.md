# 21-17 Corrosion

Ordinary corrosion is the redox process by which metals are oxidized by oxygen, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, in the presence of moisture. There are other kinds, but this is the most common. The problem of corrosion and its prevention are of both theoretical and practical interest. Corrosion is responsible for the loss of billions of dollars annually in metal products. The mechanism of corrosion has been studied extensively. It is now known that the oxidation of metals occurs most readily at points of strain (where the metals are most "active"). Thus, a steel nail, which is mostly iron (Section 22-7), first corrodes at the tip and head (Figure 21-11). A bent nail corrodes most readily at the bend.

A point of strain in a steel object acts as an anode where the iron is oxidized to iron(II) ions, and pits are formed (Figure 21-12).

$$
\mathrm{Fe} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \quad \text { (oxidation, anode) }
$$

The electrons produced then flow through the nail to areas exposed to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. These act as

> Figure 21-11 (a) A bent nail corrodes at points of strain and "active" metal atoms. (b) Two nails were placed in an agar gel that contained phenolphthalein and potassium ferricyanide, $\mathrm{K}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]$. As the nails corrode, they produce $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions at each end and at the bend (an oxidation, so these are anodic regions). $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions react with $\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]^{3-}$ ions to form $\mathrm{Fe}_{3}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]_{2}$, an intensely blue-colored compound. The rest of each nail functions as the cathode, at which water is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions. The $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions turn phenolphthalein pink.

> Figure 21-12 The corrosion of iron. Pitting appears at the anodic region, where iron metal is initially oxidized to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, and then to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. Rust appears at the cathodic region.


At the same time, the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions migrate through the moisture on the surface. The overall reaction is obtained by balancing the electron transfer and adding the two half-reactions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2(\mathrm{Fe}\left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+2 e^{-}\right) \\
& \mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+4 e^{-} \begin{array}{l}
\text { (oxidation, anode) } \\
\text { (reduction, cathode) }
\end{array} \\
& \hline 2 \mathrm{Fe}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \\
& \text {(net reaction) }
\end{aligned}
$$

The $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ions can migrate from the anode through the solution toward the cathode region, where they combine with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions to form iron(II) hydroxide. Iron is further oxidized by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the +3 oxidation state. The material we call rust is a complex hydrated form of iron(III) oxides and hydroxides with variable water composition; it can be represented as $\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The overall reaction for the rusting of iron is

$$
2 \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{~s})+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s})
