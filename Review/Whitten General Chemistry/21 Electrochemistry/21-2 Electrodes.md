# 21-2 Electrodes

Electrodes are surfaces on which oxidation or reduction half-reactions occur. They may or may not participate in the reactions. Those that do not react are called inert electrodes. Regardless of the kind of cell, electrolytic or voltaic, the electrodes are identified as follows.

> The cathode is defined as the electrode at which reduction occurs as electrons are gained by some species. The anode is the electrode at which oxidation occurs as electrons are lost by some species.

Each of these can be either the positive or the negative electrode.

## Electrolytic Cells

In some electrochemical cells, nonspontaneous (reactant-favored) chemical reactions are forced to occur by the input of electrical energy. This process is called electrolysis. An electrolytic cell consists of a container for the reaction material with electrodes immersed in the reaction material and connected to a source of direct current. Inert electrodes are often used so that they do not become involved in the reaction.
