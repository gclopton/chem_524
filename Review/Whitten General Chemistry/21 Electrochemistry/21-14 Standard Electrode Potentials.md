# 21-14 Standard Electrode Potentials

We can develop a series of representative electrode potentials by measuring the potentials of other standard electrodes versus the SHE in the way we have described for the standard Zn -SHE and standard Cu -SHE voltaic cells. The standard electrode potential for any half-cell is its potential with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode, measured at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

The activity series (Table 6-9) is based on standard electrode potentials. when the concentration of each ion in the solution is $1 M$ and the pressure of any gas involved is 1 atm .

By agreement, we always tabulate the standard electrode potential for each half-cell as a reduction process.

Many electrodes involve metals or nonmetals in contact with their ions. We saw (Section 21-12) that the standard Zn electrode behaves as the anode versus the SHE and that the standard oxidation potential for the Zn half-cell is 0.763 volt.

The reduction potential for the standard zinc electrode (to act as a cathode relative to the SHE) is therefore the negative of this, or -0.763 volt.

toward the SHE. Electrodes with positive $E^{0}$ values for reduction half-reactions act as cathodes versus the SHE. Those with negative $E^{0}$ values for reduction half-reactions act as anodes versus the SHE.

| Reduction occurs more readily than the reduction of $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. | Reduction is more difficult than the reduction of $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. |

> The more positive the $E^{0}$ value for a half-reaction, the greater the tendency for the half-reaction to occur in the forward direction as written. Conversely, the more negative the $E^{0}$ value for a half-reaction, the greater the tendency for the half-reaction to occur in the reverse direction as written.

Table 21-2 lists standard reduction potentials for a few elements.

1. The species on the left side are all cations of metals, hydrogen ions, or elemental nonmetals. These are all oxidizing agents (oxidized forms of the elements). Their strengths as oxidizing agents increase from top to bottom, that is, as the $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ values become more positive. Fluorine, $\mathrm{F}_{2}$, is the strongest oxidizing agent, and $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ is a very weak oxidizing agent.
2. The species on the right side are free metals, hydrogen, or anions of nonmetals. These are all reducing agents (reduced forms of the elements). Their strengths as reducing agents increase from bottom to top, that is, as the $E_{\text {reduction }}^{0}$ values become more negative. Metallic Li is a very strong reducing agent, and $\mathrm{F}^{-}$is a very weak reducing agent.

> The more positive the reduction potential, the stronger the species on the left is as an oxidizing agent and the weaker the species on the right is as a reducing agent.
