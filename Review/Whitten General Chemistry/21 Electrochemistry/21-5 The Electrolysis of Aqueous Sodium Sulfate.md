# 21-5 The Electrolysis of Aqueous Sodium Sulfate

In the electrolysis of aqueous sodium sulfate using inert electrodes, we observe the following.

1. Gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is produced at one electrode. The solution becomes basic around that electrode.
2. Gaseous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is produced at the other electrode. The solution becomes acidic around that electrode.

As in the previous example, water is reduced in preference to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$at the cathode. Observation 2 suggests that water is also preferentially oxidized relative to the sulfate ion, $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$, at the anode (Figure 21-4).

$$
\begin{aligned}
2\left(2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+2 e^{-}\right. & \left.\longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-}\right) \\
2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \text { (reduction, cathode) } \\
\hline 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} & \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+4 e^{-}
\end{aligned} \text {(oxidation, anode) } \text { }
$$

> Figure 21-4 The electrolysis of aqueous $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ produces $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ at the cathode and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at the anode. Bromthymol blue indicator has been added to the solution. This indicator turns blue in the basic solution near the cathode (where $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is produced) and yellow in the acidic solution near the anode (where $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is formed).

> Figure 21-3 Electrolysis of aqueous NaCl solution. Although several reactions occur at both the anode and the cathode, the net result is the production of $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and NaOH at the cathode and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ at the anode. A few drops of phenolphthalein indicator were added to the solution. The solution turns pink at the cathode, where $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions are formed and the solution becomes basic.

> The electrolysis of the aqueous solution of KI, another Group 1A–Group 7A salt. At the cathode (left), water is reduced to $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions, turning the phenolphthalein indicator pink. The characteristic brownish color of aqueous $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ appears at the anode (right). Can you identify which tube is collecting the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas and the name of the electrode producing it (anode or cathode)?

An ampere is usually called an "amp." For comparison, a 100-watt household light bulb uses a current of about 0.8 ampere.

The net result is the electrolysis of water. This occurs because $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is both more readily reduced than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and more readily oxidized than $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. The ions of $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ conduct the current through the solution, but they take no part in the reaction.
