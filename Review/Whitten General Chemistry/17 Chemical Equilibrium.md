Chemical equilibrium plays an important role in the formation of many caves. Water and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ react to form carbonic acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which can slowly dissolve limestone (calcium carbonate, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ ) to make the more soluble calcium bicarbonate, $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$. The dissolution of $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ can eventually form what are called solution caves. Stalactites (think "tight to the ceiling") and stalagmites are formed from equilibrium processes when calcium bicarbonate solution dripping from the ceiling

## 17-1 Basic Concepts

Chemical reactions that can occur in either direction are called reversible reactions. Most reversible reactions do not go to completion. That is, even when reactants are mixed in stoichiometric quantities, they are not completely converted to products.

Reversible reactions can be represented in general terms as follows, where the capital letters represent formulas and the lowercase letters represent the stoichiometric coefficients in the balanced equation.

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}
$$

The double arrow ( ⟹) indicates that the reaction is reversible-that is, both the forward and reverse reactions occur simultaneously. In discussions of chemical equilibrium, the substances that appear on the left side of the balanced chemical equation are called the "reactants," and those on the right side are called the "products." In fact, the reaction can proceed in either direction. When A and B react to form C and D at the same rate at which C and D react to form A and B , the system is at equilibrium.

Chemical equilibrium exists when two opposing reactions occur simultaneously at the same rate.

Chemical equilibria are dynamic equilibria; that is, individual molecules are continually reacting, even though the overall composition of the reaction mixture does not change. In a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium is said to lie toward the right if more C and D are present than A and B (product-favored), and to lie toward the left if more A and B are present (reactant-favored).

Consider a case in which the coefficients in the equation for a reaction are all 1 . When substances A and B react, the rate of the forward reaction decreases as time passes because the concentration of A and B decrease.

$$
\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D}
$$

As the concentrations of C and D build up, they start to re-form A and B.

$$
\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D} \longrightarrow \mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{B}
$$

As more C and D molecules are formed, more can react, and so the rate of reaction between C and D increases with time. Eventually, the two reactions occur at the same rate, and the system is at equilibrium (Figure 17-1).

## S top \& Think

In Chapter 7 the single line with an arrowhead on each end ⟷ was introduced as a way of indicating resonance. We do not use it to indicate that a reaction is reversible. The double arrow ⇌ is used to indicate a reversible reaction or an equilibrium.

The dynamic nature of chemical equilibrium can be proved experimentally by inserting radioactive atoms into a small percentage of reactant or product molecules. Even when the initial mixture is at equilibrium, radioactive atoms eventually appear both in reactant and in product molecules.

The numbers in this discussion were determined experimentally.

A setup such as this is called a "reaction summary." The ratio in the "change due to rxn" line is always determined by the coefficients in the balanced equation.

Figure 17-1 Variation in the concentrations of species present in the $\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D}$ system as equilibrium is approached, beginning with equal concentrations of $A$ and $B$ only. For this reaction, production of products is favored. As we will see, this corresponds to a value of the equilibrium constant greater than 1. Brackets, [ ], represent the concentration, in moles per liter, of the species enclosed within them. The time axis may be in any convenient units-seconds, minutes, hours, and so on.

If a reaction begins with only C and D present, the rate of reaction (2) decreases with time, and the rate of reaction (1) increases with time until the two rates are equal.

## The $\mathbf{S O}_{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{S O}_{\mathbf{3}}$ System

Consider the reversible reaction of sulfur dioxide with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide at 1500 K .

$$
2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

Suppose 0.400 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and 0.200 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are injected into a closed 1.00-liter container. When equilibrium is established (at time $t_{\mathrm{e}}$, Figure 17-2a), we find that 0.056 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ has formed and that 0.344 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and 0.172 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ remain unreacted. The amount of product at equilibrium does not increase further if the reaction is given additional time. These changes are summarized in the following reaction summary, using molarity units rather than moles. (They are numerically identical here because the volume of the reaction vessel is 1.00 liter.) The changes due to reaction are represented by the changes in concentrations.

|  | $2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | + | $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | $\rightleftharpoons$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| initial conc'n | $0.400 M$ | $0.200 M$ |  | $2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})$ |
| change due to rxn | $-0.056 M$ |  | $-0.028 M$ |  |
| equilibrium conc'n | $0.344 M$ |  | $0.172 M$ |  |
|  |  |  | $0.056 M$ |  |

In a similar experiment, 0.500 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ is introduced alone into a closed 1.00 -liter container. When equilibrium is established (at time $t_{\mathrm{e}}$, Figure 17-2b), 0.076 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$, 0.212 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and 0.424 mole of $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ are present. These equilibrium amounts differ from those in the previous case, but they are related in an important way, as we will see in the next section. This time the reaction proceeds from right to left as the equation is written. The changes in concentration are in the same $2: 1: 2$ ratio as in the previous case, as required by the coefficients of the balanced equation. The time required to reach equilibrium may be longer or shorter.

| equilibrium conc'n | $0.424 M$ |  | $0.212 M$ |  | $0.076 M$ |

The results of these experiments are summarized in the following table and in Figure 17-2.

## 17-2 The Equilibrium Constant

Suppose a reversible reaction occurs by a single elementary reaction step:

$$
2 \mathrm{~A}+\mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}
$$

The rate of the forward reaction is $\operatorname{rate}_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}}[\mathrm{A}]^{2}[\mathrm{~B}]$; the rate of the reverse reaction is rate $_{\mathrm{r}}=k_{\mathrm{r}}\left[\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}\right]$. In these expressions, $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{r}}$ are the specific rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. By definition, the two rates are equal at equilibrium $\left(\right.$ rate $_{\mathrm{f}}=$ rate $\left._{\mathrm{r}}\right)$. So we write

$$
k_{\mathrm{f}}[\mathrm{~A}]^{2}[\mathrm{~B}]=k_{\mathrm{r}}\left[\mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}\right] \quad \text { (at equilibrium) }
$$

Dividing both sides of this equation by $k_{\mathrm{r}}$ and by $[\mathrm{A}]^{2}[\mathrm{~B}]$ gives

$$
\frac{k_{\mathrm{f}}}{k_{\mathrm{r}}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}\right]}{[\mathrm{A}]^{2}[\mathrm{~B}]}
$$

At any specific temperature, both $k_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{r}}$ are constants, so $k_{\mathrm{f}} / k_{\mathrm{r}}$ is also a constant.
This ratio is given a special name and symbol, the equilibrium constant, $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{c}}$ or simply $\boldsymbol{K}$.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}\right]}{[\mathrm{A}]^{2}[\mathrm{~B}]} \quad \text { (at equilibrium) }
$$

We can show that even if the overall reaction occurs by a multistep mechanism, the equilibrium constant is the product and ratio of the rate constants for each step of the mechanism. Regardless of the mechanism by which any reaction occurs, the concentrations of reaction intermediates cancel out and the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction has the same form. For a reaction in general terms, the equilibrium constant can

## S top \& Think

Remember that for elementary (or fundamental) reactions the coefficients do correspond to the orders of the reactant and product concentrations. always be written as follows:

The subscript c refers to concentrations. The brackets, [ ], in this expression indicate equilibrium concentrations in moles per liter.

Moles per liter will also be referred to as molarity ( $M$ ) or molar concentration.

We emphasize that the concentrations in the equilibrium constant expression are those at equilibrium.

You can think of the activity as the molar concentration of a solution component or the partial pressure of a gas with the units omitted.

## S top \& Think

These are three very important ideas.

$$
\text { For } \underbrace{a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B}}_{\text {reactants }} \rightleftharpoons \overbrace{c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}}^{\text {products }}, \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\overbrace{\frac{\overbrace{[\mathrm{C}]_{\mathrm{eq}}^{c}[\mathrm{D}]_{\mathrm{eq}}^{d}}^{a}}{\underbrace{\text { product }}_{\substack{\text { reactant } \\ \text { concentrations }}}}}^{\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{eq}}^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]_{\mathrm{eq}}^{b}}{\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{eq}}}}
$$

The equilibrium constant, $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{c}}$, is defined as the product of the equilibrium concentrations (in moles per liter) of the products, each raised to the power that corresponds to its coefficient in the balanced equation, divided by the product of the equilibrium concentrations of reactants, each raised to the power that corresponds to its coefficient in the balanced equation.

Numerical values for $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ can be determined from experiments or from thermodynamic data (Section 17-12). Some equilibrium constant expressions and their numerical values at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are

$$
\begin{array}{lll}
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{~g}) & K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{NO}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=4.5 \times 10^{-31} \\
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{~g}) & K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}\right][\mathrm{HCl}]}{\left[\mathrm{CH}_{4}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}=1.2 \times 10^{18} \\
\mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) & K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}=3.6 \times 10^{8}
\end{array}
$$

Remember that calculations with $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ values always involve equilibrium values of concentrations.
The thermodynamic definition of the equilibrium constant involves activities rather than concentrations. The activity of a component of an ideal mixture is the ratio of its concentration or partial pressure to a standard concentration ( $1 M$ ) or a standard pressure (1 atm). For now, we can consider the activity of each species to be a dimensionless quantity whose numerical value can be determined as follows.

1. For any pure liquid or pure solid, the activity is taken as 1 .
2. For components of ideal solutions, the activity of each component is taken to be the ratio of its molar concentration to a standard concentration of $1 M$, so the units cancel.
3. For gases in an ideal mixture, the activity of each component is taken to be the ratio of its partial pressure to a standard pressure of 1 atm , so again the units cancel.

Because of the use of activities, the equilibrium constant has no units; the values we put into $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ are numerically equal to molar concentrations, but are dimensionless, that is, they have no units. Therefore, calculations involving equilibrium are frequently carried out without units; we will follow that practice in this text.

The magnitude of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a measure of the extent to which reaction occurs. For any balanced chemical equation, the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$

1. is constant at a given temperature
2. changes if the temperature changes
3. does not depend on the initial concentrations

A value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ much greater than 1 indicates that the "numerator concentrations" (products) would be much greater than the "denominator concentrations" (reactants); this means that at equilibrium most of the reactants would be converted into products. For example, the reaction $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})+\mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})$ shown earlier goes nearly to completion; in Chapter 15, we called such a reaction "product-favored." On the other hand, if $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is quite small, equilibrium is established when most of the reactants remain unreacted and only small amounts of products are formed. The reaction $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{g})$ shown earlier reaches equilibrium with only a tiny amount of NO present; earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 15, we called such a reaction "reactant-favored."

For a given chemical reaction at a specific temperature, the product of the concentrations of the products formed by the reaction, each raised to the appropriate power, divided by the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the appropriate power, always has the same value, that is, $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. This does not mean that the individual equilibrium concentrations for a given reaction are always the same, but it does mean that this particular numerical combination of their values ( $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ ) is constant.

Consider again the $\mathrm{SO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ equilibrium described in Section 17-1. We can use the equilibrium concentrations from either experiment to calculate the value of the equilibrium constant for this reaction at 1500 K .

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\text { From experiment 1: } & 2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \\
\text { equilibrium conc'n } & 0.344 M \\
2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \\
0.172 M & 0.056 M
\end{array}
$$

Substituting the numerical values (without units) into the equilibrium expression gives the value of the equilibrium constant.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=\frac{(0.056)^{2}}{(0.344)^{2}(0.172)}=0.15
$$

Alternatively,

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\text { From experiment 2: } & 2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \begin{array}{l}
2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \\
\text { equilibrium conc'n }
\end{array} \\
0.424 M \\
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{(0.076)^{2}}{(0.424)^{2}(0.212)}=0.212 M
\end{array}
$$

No matter what combinations of reactant and product concentrations we start with, the resulting equilibrium concentrations at 1500 K for this reversible reaction would always give the same value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}, 0.15$.

For the reversible reaction written as it is with $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ shown as reactants and $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ shown as the product, $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is 0.15 at 1500 K .

## Example 17-1 Calculation of $K_{c}$

Some nitrogen and hydrogen are placed in an empty 5.00 -liter container at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. When equilibrium is established, 3.01 mol of $\mathrm{N}_{2}, 2.10 \mathrm{~mol}$ of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and 0.565 mol of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ are present. Evaluate $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the following reaction at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

The equilibrium concentrations are obtained by dividing the number of moles of each reactant and product by the volume, 5.00 liters. Then we substitute these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression.

## Solution

The equilibrium concentrations are

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right] } & =3.01 \mathrm{~mol} / 5.00 \mathrm{~L}=0.602 M \\
{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right] } & =2.10 \mathrm{~mol} / 5.00 \mathrm{~L}=0.420 M \\
{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right] } & =0.565 \mathrm{~mol} / 5.00 \mathrm{~L}=0.113 M
\end{aligned}
$$

In the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression, the power for each reactant and product is equal to its coefficient in the balanced chemical equation.

Remember that the concentrations in $K_{c}$ calculations are equilibrium values of molar concentration. But, since we should be using activities, which have no units, no concentration units are carried along in the calculation.

## S top \& Think

The small value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ indicates that the equilibrium lies to the left, that is, the reaction is reactant-favored.

## S top \& Think

Remember that concentrations appear with no units in equilibrium calculations.

We substitute these numerical values into the expression for $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}=\frac{(0.113)^{2}}{(0.602)(0.420)^{3}}=0.286
$$

Thus, for the reaction of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we can write

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}=0.286
$$

The value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ from Example 17-1 is much different from the value given earlier for the same reaction at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For this reaction, products are favored at the lower temperature ( $K_{\mathrm{c}}=3.6 \times 10^{8}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), whereas reactants are favored at the higher temperature ( $K_{\mathrm{c}}=0.286$ at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). You may recall from Chapter 16 that the rate constant, $k$, for any reaction increases with increasing temperature. But the value of $K_{c}$ for different reactions responds differently to temperature changes; for some reactions, $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ increases with increasing temperature, whereas for others $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ decreases with increasing temperature, as we will see in Sections 17-6 and 17-13.

## Example 17-2 Calculation of $K_{c}$

We put 10.0 moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into a $2.00-\mathrm{L}$ container at some temperature, where it decomposes according to

$$
2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

At equilibrium, 2.20 moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ remain. Calculate the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the reaction.

## Plan

We express all concentrations in moles per liter. The mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation allows us to find the changes in concentrations of the other substances in the reaction. We use the reaction summary to find the equilibrium concentrations to use in the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression.

## Solution

At equilibrium, $2.20 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ remain, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
?-\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { reacting } & =10.00 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { initial }-2.20 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { remaining } \\
& =7.80 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { reacting }
\end{aligned}
$$

The initial $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]=(10.00 \mathrm{~mol}) /(2.00 \mathrm{~L})=5.00 M$; the concentration of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ that reacts is $(7.80 \mathrm{~mol}) /(2.00 \mathrm{~L})=3.90 M$. From the balanced chemical equation, each $2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ that react produces $2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2}$ and $1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, or a reaction ratio of

$$
1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { reacting : } 1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \text { formed : } \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2} \text { formed }
$$

We can now write the reaction summary.

|  | $2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}) \rightleftharpoons$ | $2 \mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | + |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| initial | $5.00 M$ | 0 | 0 |
| change due to rxn | $-3.90 M$ | $+3.90 M$ | $+\frac{1}{2}(3.90)$ |
|  |  |  | = |
| equilibrium | $1.10 M$ | $3.90 M$ | $1.95 M$ |

We put these equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression and evaluate $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]^{2}}=\frac{(3.90)^{2}(1.95)}{(1.10)^{2}}=24.5
$$

## You should now work Exercises 24 and 28.

## 17-3 Variation of $K_{c}$ with the Form of the Balanced Equation

The value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ depends on how we write the balanced equation for the reaction. We wrote the equation for the reaction of $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to produce $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$, and its equilibrium constant expression as

$$
2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \text { and } \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}=0.15
$$

Suppose we write the equation for the same reaction in reverse. The equation and its equilibrium constant, written this way, are

$$
2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \text { and } \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]^{2}}=\frac{1}{K_{\mathrm{c}}}=\frac{1}{0.15}=6.7
$$

We see that $K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime}$, the equilibrium constant for the equation written in reverse, is the reciprocal of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, the equilibrium constant for the original equation.
If the equation for the reaction were written as

$$
\mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \text { and } \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime \prime}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}^{1 / 2}=0.39
$$

If an equation for a reaction is multiplied by any factor, $n$, then the original value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is raised to the $n$th power. Thus, we must always write the balanced chemical equation to accompany the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for a chemical reaction.

## Example 17-3 Variation of the Form of $K_{c}$

You are given the following chemical equation and its equilibrium constant at a given temperature.

$$
2 \mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=4.0 \times 10^{4}
$$

Write the expression for, and calculate the numerical value of, the equilibrium constant for each of the following at the same temperature.
(a) $4 \mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{g})+2 \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 4 \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})+2 \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$
(b) $\mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$

## Plan

We recall the definition of the equilibrium constant. For the original equation,

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{HCl}]^{2}\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{HBr}]^{2}\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}=4.0 \times 10^{4}
$$

## Solution

(a) The original equation has been multiplied by 2 , so $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ must be squared.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime}=\frac{[\mathrm{HCl}]^{4}\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]^{2}}{[\mathrm{HBr}]^{4}\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]^{2}} \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime}=\left(K_{\mathrm{c}}\right)^{2}=\left(4.0 \times 10^{4}\right)^{2}=1.6 \times 10^{9}
$$

(b) The original equation has been multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$ (divided by 2 ), so $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ must be raised to the $\frac{1}{2}$ power. The value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime \prime}$ is the square root of the original $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ value.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}^{\prime \prime}=\frac{[\mathrm{HCl}]\left[\mathrm{Br}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}}{[\mathrm{HBr}]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]^{1 / 2}}=\sqrt{K_{c}}=\sqrt{4.0 \times 10^{4}}=2.0 \times 10^{2}
$$

## You should now work Exercise 30.

## top \& Think

Reversing an equation is the same as multiplying all coefficients by -1 . This reverses the roles of "reactants" and "products."

We see that $K_{c}^{\prime \prime}$ is the square root of $K_{c} \cdot K_{c}^{1 / 2}$ means the square root of $K_{c}$.

A coefficient of $\frac{1}{2}$ refers to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a mole, not $\frac{1}{2}$ of a molecule.

The reaction quotient is sometimes called the mass action expression.

When the forward reaction occurs to a greater extent than the reverse reaction, we say that a net forward reaction has occurred.

## S top \& Think

Once the balanced chemical equation is written, the substances on the left are called reactants and the ones on the right are products, no matter which way the reaction proceeds.

## 17-4 The Reaction Quotient

The reaction quotient, $\boldsymbol{Q}$, for the general reaction is given as follows.

$$
\text { For } a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D}, \quad Q=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]^{c}[\mathrm{D}]^{d}}{[\mathrm{~A}]^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]^{b}} \longleftrightarrow \longleftrightarrow^{\begin{array}{l}
\text { not necessarily } \\
\text { equilibrium } \\
\text { concentrations }
\end{array}}
$$

The reaction quotient has the same form as the equilibrium constant, but it involves specific values that are not necessarily equilibrium concentrations. If they are equilibrium concentrations, then $Q=K_{\mathrm{c}}$. The concept of the reaction quotient is very useful. We can compare the magnitude of $Q$ with that of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for a reaction under given conditions to decide whether the forward or the reverse reaction must occur to a greater extent to establish equilibrium.

We can think of the reaction quotient, $Q$, as a measure of the progress of the reaction. When the mixture contains only reactants, the concentrations in the numerator are zero, so $Q=0$. As the reaction proceeds to the right, the product concentrations (numerator) increase and the reactant concentrations (denominator) decrease, so $Q$ would increase to an infinitely large value when all reactants have been consumed and only products remain. The value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is a particular value of $Q$ that represents equilibrium mixtures for the reaction.

If at any time $Q<K_{\mathrm{c}}$, the forward reaction would occur to a greater extent than the reverse reaction for equilibrium to be established. This is because when $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$, the numerator of $Q$ is too small and the denominator is too large. To increase the numerator and to reduce the denominator, A and B must react to produce C and D . Conversely, if $Q>K_{\mathrm{c}}$, the reverse reaction would occur to a greater extent than the forward reaction for equilibrium to be reached. When the value of $Q$ reaches the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, the system is at equilibrium, so no further net reaction occurs.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
Q<K_{c} & \text { Forward reaction predominates until equilibrium is established. } \\
Q=K_{c} & \text { System is at equilibrium. } \\
Q>K_{c} & \text { Reverse reaction predominates until equilibrium is established. }
\end{array}
$$

In Example 17-4 we calculate the value of $Q$ and compare it with the known value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ to predict the direction of the reaction that leads to equilibrium.

## Example 17-4 The Reaction Quotient

At a very high temperature, $K_{\mathrm{c}}=65.0$ for the following reaction.

$$
2 \mathrm{HI}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

The following concentrations were detected in a mixture. Is the system at equilibrium? If not, in which direction must the reaction proceed for equilibrium to be established?

## Plan

We substitute these concentrations into the expression for the reaction quotient to calculate $Q$. Then we compare $Q$ with $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ to see whether the system is at equilibrium.

## Solution

$$
Q=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{HI}]^{2}}=\frac{(2.80)(3.40)}{(0.500)^{2}}=38.1
$$

But $K_{\mathrm{c}}=65.0$, so $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$. The system is not at equilibrium. For equilibrium to be established, the value of $Q$ must increase until it equals $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. This can occur only if the numerator increases and the denominator decreases. Thus, the forward (left-to-right) reaction must occur to a greater extent than the reverse reaction; that is, some HI must react to form more $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ to reach equilibrium.

You should now work Exercises 38, 40, and 42.

## 17-5 Uses of the Equilibrium Constant, $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{c}}$

We have seen (Section 17-2) how to calculate the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ from one set of equilibrium concentrations. Once that value has been obtained, the process can be turned around to calculate equilibrium concentrations from the equilibrium constant.

## Example 17-5 Finding Equilibrium Concentrations

The equation for the following reaction and the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ at a given temperature are given. An equilibrium mixture in a 1.00 -liter container contains 0.25 mol of $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$ and 0.16 mol of $\mathrm{PCl}_{3}$. What equilibrium concentration of $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ must be present?

$$
\mathrm{PCl}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{PCl}_{5}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=1.9
$$

## Plan

We write the equilibrium constant expression and its value. Only one term, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]$, is unknown. We solve for it.

## Solution

Because the volume of the container is 1.00 liter, the molar concentration (mol/L) of each substance is numerically equal to the number of moles. The equilibrium constant expression and its numeric value are

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}=1.9 \\
{\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]=\frac{\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{5}\right]}{K_{\mathrm{c}}\left[\mathrm{PCl}_{3}\right]}=\frac{(0.25)}{(1.9)(0.16)}=0.82 \mathrm{M}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Often we know the starting concentrations and want to know how much of each reactant and each product would be present at equilibrium. The next two examples illustrate this important kind of calculation.

## Example 17-6 Finding Equilibrium Concentrations

For the following reaction, the equilibrium constant is 49.0 at a certain temperature. If 0.400 mol each of A and B are placed in a 2.00 -liter container at that temperature, what concentrations of all species are present at equilibrium?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/fa77330c-3a05-4e07-8566-1c02a64a1eca-10.jpg?height=121&width=424&top_left_y=602&top_left_x=1311)
$Q$ is less than $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, so reaction proceeds to the right, forming more products

The equilibrium constant is a "constant" only if the temperature does not change.

## S top \& Think

When the value of $K_{c}$ and the equilibrium values of all but one concentration are known, the unknown concentration can be found.

The coefficients in the equation are all 1 's, so the reaction ratio must be $1: 1: 1: 1$.

## S top \& Think

We see that the equilibrium concentrations of products are much greater than those of reactants because $K_{c}$ is much greater than 1 .

## Plan

First we find the initial concentrations. Then we write the reaction summary and represent the equilibrium concentrations algebraically. Finally we substitute the algebraic representations of equilibrium concentrations into the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression and find the equilibrium concentrations.

## Solution

The initial concentrations are

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
{[\mathrm{A}]=\frac{0.400 \mathrm{~mol}}{2.00 \mathrm{~L}}=0.200 M} & {[\mathrm{C}]=0 M} \\
{[\mathrm{~B}]=\frac{0.400 \mathrm{~mol}}{2.00 \mathrm{~L}}=0.200 M} & {[\mathrm{D}]=0 M}
\end{array}
$$

We know that the reaction can only proceed to the right because only "reactants" are present. The reaction summary includes the values, or symbols for the values, of (1) initial concentrations, (2) changes in concentrations, and (3) concentrations at equilibrium.

Let $x=$ moles per liter of A that react; then $x=$ moles per liter of B that react and $x=$ moles per liter of C and of D that are formed.

|  | $\mathrm{A}+$ | B | $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}$ | + | D |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| initial | $0.200 M$ | $0.200 M$ |  | $0 M$ | $0 M$ |
| change due to rxn | $-x M$ | $-x M$ |  | $+x M$ | $+x M$ |
| at equilibrium | $(0.200-x) M$ | $(0.200-x) M$ |  | $x M$ | $x M$ |

Now $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is known, but concentrations are not. But the equilibrium concentrations have all been expressed in terms of the single variable $x$. We substitute the equilibrium concentrations (not the initial ones) into the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression and solve for $x$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}=49.0 \\
\frac{(x)(x)}{(0.200-x)(0.200-x)}=\frac{x^{2}}{(0.200-x)^{2}}=49.0
\end{gathered}
$$

This quadratic equation has a perfect square on both sides. We solve it by taking the square roots of both sides of the equation and then rearranging for $x$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{x}{0.200-x}=7.00 \\
x=1.40-7.00 x \quad 8.00 x=1.40 \quad x=\frac{1.40}{8.00}=0.175
\end{gathered}
$$

Now we know the value of $x$, so the equilibrium concentrations are
$[\mathrm{A}]=(0.200-x) M=0.025 M ;$
[C] $=x M=0.175 M$;
$[\mathrm{B}]=(0.200-x) M=0.025 M$;
[D] $\quad=x M=0.175 M$

To check our answers, we use the equilibrium concentrations to calculate $Q$ and verify that its value is equal to $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

$$
Q=\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}=\frac{(0.175)(0.175)}{(0.025)(0.025)}=49 \quad \text { Recall that } K_{\mathrm{c}}=49.0
$$

The ideas developed in Example 17-6 may also be applied to cases in which the reactants are mixed in nonstoichiometric amounts. This is shown in Example 17-7.

## Example 17-7 Finding Equilibrium Concentrations

Consider the same system as in Example 17-6 at the same temperature. If 0.600 mol of A and 0.200 mol of B are mixed in a 2.00 -liter container and allowed to reach equilibrium, what are the equilibrium concentrations of all species?

## Plan

We proceed as we did in Example 17-6. The only difference is that now we have nonstoichiometric starting amounts of reactants.

## Solution

As in Example 17-6, we let $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of A that react; then $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of B that react, and $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of C and D formed.

|  | A | B | $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}$ | + | D |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| initial | $0.300 M$ | $0.100 M$ | $0 M$ | $0 M$ |  |
| change due to rxn | $-x M$ | $-x M$ |  | $+x M$ | $+x M$ |
| equilibrium | $(0.300-x) M$ | $(0.100-x) M$ |  | $x M$ | $x M$ |

The initial concentrations are governed by the amounts of reactants mixed together. But changes in concentrations due to reaction must still occur in the $1: 1: 1: 1$ ratio required by the coefficients in the balanced equation.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}=49.0 \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{(x)(x)}{(0.300-x)(0.100-x)}=49.0
$$

We can arrange this quadratic equation into the standard form, $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x^{2}}{0.0300-0.400 x+x^{2}} & =49.0 \\
x^{2} & =1.47-19.6 x+49.0 x^{2} \\
48.0 x^{2}-19.6 x+1.47 & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

Quadratic equations can be solved by use of the quadratic formula.

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}
$$

In this case $a=48.0, b=-19.6$, and $c=1.47$. Substituting these values gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
x=\frac{-(-19.6) \pm \sqrt{(-19.6)^{2}-4(48.0)(1.47)}}{2(48.0)} \\
\quad=\frac{19.6 \pm 10.1}{96.0}=0.309 \text { or } 0.099
\end{gathered}
$$

Evaluating the quadratic formula always yields two roots. One root (the answer) has physical meaning. The other root, while mathematically correct, is extraneous; that is, it has no physical meaning. The value of $x$ is defined as the number of moles of A per liter that react and the number of moles of B per liter that react. No more B can be consumed than was initially present $(0.100 M)$, so $x=0.309$ is the extraneous root. Thus, $x=0.099$ is the root that has physical meaning. The equilibrium concentrations are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {[\mathrm{A}]=(0.300-x) M=0.201 M ; \quad[\mathrm{B}]=(0.100-x) M=0.001 M ;} \\
& {[\mathrm{C}]=[\mathrm{D}]=x M=0.099 M}
\end{aligned}
$$

## You should now work Exercises 34, 44, and 46.

The denominator of this equation is not a perfect square, so a different algebraic approach is required.

## S top \& Think

You can put the calculated equilibrium concentrations into the expression for $Q$ to check to see that $Q=K_{c}$ (within rounding error), as was shown at the end of Example 17-6.

Check Example 17-6:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q & =\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}=\frac{(0.175)(0.175)}{(0.025)(0.025)} \\
Q & =49=K_{\mathrm{c}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Check Example 17-7:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q & =\frac{(0.099)(0.099)}{(0.201)(0.001)} \\
Q & =49=K_{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

LeChatelier is pronounced "le-SHOT-lee-ay."

Remember that the value of an equilibrium constant changes only with temperature.

For reactions involving gases at constant temperature, changes in volume cause changes in pressure, and vice versa.

Initial Concentrations ( $\boldsymbol{M}$ )
|  | $[$ A $]$ | $[$ B $]$ | $[$ C $]$ | $[$ D $]$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Example 17-6 | 0.200 | 0.200 | 0 | 0 |
| Example 17-7 | 0.300 | 0.100 | 0 | 0 |


## Problem-Solving Tip Solving Quadratic EquationsWhich Root Shall We Use?

Equilibrium Concentrations ( $\boldsymbol{M}$ )
| $[\mathrm{A}]$ | $[\mathrm{B}]$ | $[\mathrm{C}]$ | $[\mathrm{D}]$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0.025 | 0.025 | 0.175 | 0.175 |
| 0.201 | 0.001 | 0.099 | 0.099 |


Quadratic equations can be rearranged into standard form.

$$
a x^{2}+b x+c=0
$$

All can be solved by the quadratic formula, which is

$$
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a} \quad(\text { Appendix } \mathrm{A})
$$

This formula gives two roots, both of which are mathematically correct. A foolproof way to determine which root of the equation has physical meaning is to substitute the value of the variable into the expressions for the equilibrium concentrations. For the extraneous root, one or more of these substitutions will lead to a negative concentration, which is physically impossible (there cannot be less than none of a substance present!). The correct root will give all positive concentrations. In Example 17-7, substitution of the extraneous root $x=0.309$ would give $[\mathrm{A}]=(0.300-0.309) M=-0.009 M$ and $[\mathrm{B}]=(0.100-0.309) M=-0.209 M$. Either of these concentration values would be impossible, so we would know that 0.309 is an extraneous root. You should apply this test to subsequent calculations that involve solving a quadratic equation.

The following table summarizes Examples 17-6 and 17-7.

The data from the table can be substituted into the reaction quotient expression, $Q$, as a check. Even though the reaction is initiated by different relative amounts of reactants in the two cases, the ratios of equilibrium concentrations of products to reactants (each raised to the first power) agree within roundoff error.

## 17-6 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Predictions

Once a reacting system has reached equilibrium, it remains at equilibrium until it is disturbed by some change of conditions. The guiding principle is known as LeChatelier's Principle (Section 13-6).

> If a system at equilibrium is disturbed by changing its conditions (applying a stress), the system shifts in the direction that reduces the stress. Given sufficient time, a new state of equilibrium is established.

The reaction quotient, $Q$, helps us predict the direction of this shift. Three types of changes can disturb the equilibrium of a reaction.

1. Changes in concentration
2. Changes in pressure or volume (for reactions that involve gases)
3. Changes in temperature

## Changes in Concentration

Consider the following system starting at equilibrium.

$$
\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D} \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}][\mathrm{D}]}{[\mathrm{A}][\mathrm{B}]}
$$

When more of any reactant or product is added to the system, the value of $Q$ changes so it no longer matches $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the reaction is no longer at equilibrium. The stress due to the added substance is relieved by shifting the equilibrium in the direction that consumes some of the added substance, moving the value of $Q$ back toward $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. Let us compare the mass action expressions for $Q$ and $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. If more A or B is added, then $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$, and the forward reaction occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent than the reverse reaction until equilibrium is reestablished. If more C or D is added, $Q>K_{\mathrm{c}}$, and the reverse reaction occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent until equilibrium is reestablished.

Adding or removing reactants or products changes the value of $Q$. It does not change the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. Equilibrium is then reestablished by the reaction proceeding so as to change the value of $Q$ back to the unaltered $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ value.

We can also view LeChatelier's Principle in the kinetic terms we used to introduce equilibrium. The rate of the forward reaction is proportional to the reactant concentrations raised to some powers:

$$
\operatorname{rate}_{\mathrm{f}}=k_{\mathrm{f}}[\mathrm{~A}]^{x}[\mathrm{~B}]^{y}
$$

Effects of changes in concentration on the equilibrium

$$
\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{OH}_{2}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}+4 \mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightleftharpoons\left[\mathrm{CoCl}_{4}\right]^{2-}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

A solution of $\mathrm{CoCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in isopropyl alcohol and water is purple (not shown) due to the mixture of $\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{OH}_{2}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}($ pink $)$ and $\left[\mathrm{CoCl}_{4}\right]^{2-}$ (blue). When we add concentrated HCl , the excess $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$shifts the reaction to the right (blue, right photo). Adding $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})$ removes some $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by precipitation of $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$ and favors the reaction to the left (produces more $\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{OH}_{2}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}$ ); the resulting solution is

The terminology used here is not as precise as we might like, but it is widely used. When we say that the equilibrium is "shifted to the left," we mean that the reaction to the left occurs to a greater extent than the reaction to the right.

## S top \& Think

This tabulation summarizes a lot of useful information. Study it carefully.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/fa77330c-3a05-4e07-8566-1c02a64a1eca-15.jpg?height=119&width=324&top_left_y=2154&top_left_x=174)
$Q$ is less than $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, so reaction proceeds (a) to the right, forming more products

When we add more A to an equilibrium mixture, this rate increases so that it no longer matches the rate of the reverse reaction. As the reaction proceeds to the right, consuming some A and B and forming more C and D , the forward rate diminishes and the reverse rate increases until they are again equal. At that point, a new equilibrium condition has been reached, with more C and D than were present in the original equilibrium mixture. Not all of the added A has been consumed when the new equilibrium is reached, however.

If a reactant or product is removed from a system at equilibrium, the reaction that produces that substance occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent than its reverse. If some C or D is removed, then $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$, and the forward reaction is favored until equilibrium is reestablished. If some A or B is removed, the reverse reaction is favored.

| Stress | Direction of Shift of <br> $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathbf{C}+\mathbf{D}$ |  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Increase concentration of A or B | $Q<\mathrm{K}$ | $\longrightarrow$ right |
| Increase concentration of C or D | $Q>K$ | left $\longleftrightarrow$ |
| Decrease concentration of A or B | $Q>K$ | left $\longleftrightarrow$ |
| Decrease concentration of C or D | $Q<\mathrm{K}$ | $\longrightarrow$ right |

> When a new equilibrium condition is established, (1) the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are again equal, and (2) $K_{c}$ is again satisfied by the new concentrations of reactants and products.

Practical applications of changes of this type are of great economic importance. Removing a product of a reversible reaction forces the reaction to produce more product than could be obtained if the reaction were simply allowed to reach equilibrium.

## Example 17-8 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Predictions

Given the following reaction at equilibrium in a closed container at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, predict the effect of each of the following changes on the amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ present at equilibrium: (a) forcing more $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ into the system; (b) removing some $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ from the system.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We apply LeChatelier's Principle to each part of the question. We can reach the same conclusions by comparing $Q$ with $K$, even though we don't have numerical values.

## Solution

(a) LeChatelier's Principle: Adding a substance favors the reaction that uses up that substance (forward in this case).

More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.
$Q$ vs. $K$ : At the start, the reaction is at equilibrium, so $Q=K$. Then we add more $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, which increases $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]$. Because $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]$ is in the denominator of

$$
Q=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}
$$

this decreases the value of $Q$, making $Q<K$. To reestablish equilibrium, the reaction proceeds to the right.

More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.
b) LeChatelier's Principle: Removing a substance favors the reaction that produces that substance (forward in this case).

More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.
$Q$ vs. $K$ : At the start, the reaction is at equilibrium, so $Q=K$. Then we remove some $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, which decreases $\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]$. Because [ $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ] is in the numerator of $Q$, this decreases the value of $Q$, making $Q<K$. To reestablish equilibrium, the reaction proceeds to the right.

More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.

At the new equilibrium, the concentration of any reactant or product that was added will still be greater than it was in the original equilibrium mixture. The concentration of any reactant or product that was removed will be less in the new equilibrium mixture because the reaction will have replaced only part of the removed material.

Another example of the shifting of equilibrium occurs in nature during the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in caves. Water containing carbon dioxide slowly passes through layers of limestone, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$. The limestone dissolves according to the following reaction:

$$
\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}(\mathrm{aq})
$$

Equilibrium is established when the dissolved limestone reaches the limit of its solubility:

$$
\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

When the solution reaches a cave, carbon dioxide slowly escapes from the solution, and the subsequent shift in the equilibrium causes $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ to be precipitated. Deposits of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ produce the attractive cave formations.

## Changes in Volume and Pressure

Changes in pressure have little effect on the concentrations of solids or liquids because they are only slightly compressible. Changes in pressure do cause significant changes in concentrations of gases, however. Such changes therefore affect the value of $Q$ for reactions in which the number of moles of gaseous reactants differs from the number of moles of gaseous products. For an ideal gas,

$$
P V=n R T \quad \text { or } \quad P=\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)(R T)
$$

The term ( $n / V$ ) represents concentration, that is, $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$. At constant temperature, $n, R$, and $T$ are constants. Thus, if the volume occupied by a gas decreases, its partial pressure increases and its concentration ( $n / V$ ) increases. If the volume of a gas increases, both its partial pressure and its concentration decrease.

Consider the following gaseous system at equilibrium.

$$
\mathrm{A}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{D}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{D}]^{2}}{[\mathrm{~A}]}
$$

At constant temperature, a decrease in volume (increase in pressure) increases the concentrations of both A and D . In the expression for $Q$, the concentration of D is squared and the concentration of A is raised to the first power. As a result, the numerator of $Q$ increases more than the denominator as pressure increases. Thus, $Q>K_{\mathrm{c}}$, and this equilibrium shifts to the left. Conversely, an increase in volume (decrease in pressure) shifts this reaction to the right until equilibrium is reestablished, because $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$. We can summarize the effect of pressure (volume) changes on this gas-phase system at equilibrium.

Stalactites and stalagmites are formed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$, when gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ escapes from groundwater solutions.

## S top \& Think

Study this tabulation carefully. How would these conclusions change for a reaction in which there are more moles of gaseous reactants than moles of gaseous products?

One practical application of these ideas is illustrated in the next section by the Haber process.

## S top \& Think

Many students do not realize that as a different gas is pumped into a container, the partial pressures of any gases already present do not change.

| Stress | $Q^{*}$ | Direction of Shift of A(g) ⇌ 2D(g) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Volume decrease, pressure increase | $Q>K_{\mathrm{c}}$ | Toward smaller number of moles of gas (left for this reaction) |
| Volume increase, pressure decrease | $Q<\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{c}}$ | Toward larger number of moles of gas (right for this reaction) |

*In $Q$ for this reaction, there are more moles of gaseous product than gaseous reactant.

In general, for reactions that involve gaseous reactants or products, LeChatelier's Principle allows us to predict the following results.

1. If there is no change in the total number of moles of gases in the balanced chemical equation, a volume (pressure) change does not affect the position of equilibrium; $Q$ is unchanged by the volume (or pressure) change.
2. If a balanced chemical equation involves a change in the total number of moles of gases, changing the volume (or pressure) of a reaction mixture changes the value of $Q$; it does not change the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. For such a reaction:
(a) A decrease in volume (increase in pressure) shifts a reaction in the direction that produces the smaller total number of moles of gas, until $Q$ again equals $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.
(b) An increase in volume (decrease in pressure) shifts a reaction in the direction that produces the larger total number of moles of gas, until $Q$ again equals $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

The foregoing argument applies only when pressure changes are due to volume changes. It does not apply if the total pressure of a gaseous system is raised by merely pumping in an inert gas, for example, He. If the gas that is introduced is not involved in the reaction, the partial pressure of each reacting gas remains constant, so the system remains at equilibrium.

## Example 17-9 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Predictions

(a) Given the following reaction at equilibrium in a closed container at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, predict the effect of increasing the pressure by decreasing the volume.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

(b) Make the same prediction for the following reaction at high temperature.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We apply LeChatelier's Principle to predict the effect on each reaction.

## Solution

(a) Increasing the pressure favors the reaction that produces the smaller number of moles of gas (forward in this case).

> More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.
(b) This reaction involves the same number of moles of gas on both sides, so a pressure (volume) change does not disturb the equilibrium. There is no effect on the position of equilibrium.

## Changes in Temperature

Consider the following exothermic reaction at equilibrium:

$$
\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{D}+\text { heat } \quad(\Delta H \text { is negative })
$$

Heat is produced by the forward (exothermic) reaction. Suppose we increase the temperature at constant pressure by adding heat to the system. This favors the reaction to the left, removing some of the extra heat. Lowering the temperature favors the reaction to the right as the system replaces some of the heat that was removed.

By contrast, for an endothermic reaction at equilibrium,

$$
\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{X}+\text { heat } \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Y}+\mathrm{Z} \quad(\Delta H \text { is positive })
$$

an increase in temperature at constant pressure favors the reaction to the right. A decrease in temperature favors the reaction to the left.

The value of any equilibrium constant changes as the temperature changes, as we will see in Section 17-13. Changing the temperature of a reaction at equilibrium thus causes $Q$ to differ from $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, but now this is because $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ has changed. The reaction then proceeds in the direction that moves $Q$ toward the new value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

The $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ values of exothermic reactions decrease with increasing $T$, and the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ values of endothermic reactions increase with increasing $T$. No other stresses affect the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

The gas-phase equilibrium for the exothermic reaction

$$
2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-57.2 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

The two flasks contain the same total mass of gas. $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ is brown, whereas $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ is colorless. The higher temperature $\left(50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ of the flask on the left favors the reverse reaction; this mixture is more highly colored because it contains more $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. The flask on the right, at the temperature of ice water, contains less brown $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ gas. The lower temperature favors the formation of the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$. No matter how far the equilibrium shifts, both reactants and products will always be present.

Effect of temperature changes on the equilibrium of the endothermic reaction

$$
\left[\mathrm{Co}\left(\mathrm{OH}_{2}\right)_{6}\right]^{2+}+4 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\text {heat } \rightleftharpoons\left[\mathrm{CoCl}_{4}\right]^{2-}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

We begin with a purple equilibrium mixture of the pink and blue complexes at room temperature (not shown). In hot water the forward reaction (endothermic) is favored and $K_{c}$ is higher, so the solution is blue (right photo). At $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the reverse reaction (exothermic) is favored and $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is lower, so the solution is pink (left photo). Each model shows the structure of the cobalt complex species present in highest concentration; other ions and solvent molecules are not shown.

## S top \& Think

Theoretically, in closed systems all chemical reactions are reversible and can be characterized with equilibrium constants. You may wonder if the equilibrium reactions described are somehow different from those used in previous chapters where only a single reaction arrow was used. Many of those reactions have large $K$ values and proceed to mainly make products. Equilibrium concentrations (and double reaction arrows) are most meaningful for reactions that have $K$ values that are neither extremely large nor extremely small and have observable quantities of both reactants and products at equilibrium.

Can you use the Arrhenius equation (Section 16-8) to show that lowering the activation energy barrier increases forward and reverse rates by the same factor?

For an exothermic reaction

For an endothermic reaction

## Addition of a Catalyst

Adding a catalyst to a system changes the rate of the reaction (Section 16-9), but this cannot shift the equilibrium in favor of either products or reactants. Because a catalyst affects the activation energy of both forward and reverse reactions equally, it changes both rate constants by the same factor, so their ratio, $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, does not change.

Adding a catalyst to a reaction at equilibrium has no effect; it changes neither $Q$ nor $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

The same equilibrium mixture is achieved with or without the catalyst, but the equilibrium is established more quickly in the presence of a catalyst.

Not all reactions attain equilibrium; they may occur too slowly, or else products or reactants may be continually added or removed. Such is the case with most reactions in biological systems. On the other hand, some reactions, such as typical acid-base neutralizations, achieve equilibrium very rapidly.

## Example 17-10 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Predictions

Given the following reaction at equilibrium in a closed container at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, predict the effect of each of the following changes on the amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ present at equilibrium: (a) raising the temperature; (b) lowering the temperature; (c) introducing some platinum catalyst. (d) How would the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ change in each case?

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H^{0}=-92 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

## Plan

We apply LeChatelier's Principle to each part of the question individually.

## Solution

(a) The negative value for $\Delta H$ tells us that the forward reaction is exothermic. Raising the temperature favors the endothermic reaction (reverse in this case).

> Some $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is used up.
(b) Lowering the temperature favors the exothermic reaction (forward in this case).

More $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is formed.
(c) A catalyst does not favor either reaction.

It would have no effect on the amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.
(d) In part (a), there is less product $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ present at equilibrium at the higher temperature, so the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is smaller at the higher temperature. In part (b), there is more product $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)$ present at equilibrium at the lower temperature, so the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is greater at the lower temperature. In part (c), the change (introduction of a catalyst) causes no change in equilibrium concentrations, so $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ does not change.

## You should now work Exercises 54, 57, and 58.

## 17-7 The Haber Process: A Commercial Application of Equilibrium

Nitrogen, $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, is very unreactive. The Haber process is the economically important industrial process by which atmospheric $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ is converted to ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, a soluble, reactive compound. Innumerable dyes, plastics, explosives, fertilizers, and synthetic fibers are made from ammonia. The Haber process provides insight into kinetic and thermodynamic factors that influence reaction rates and the positions of equilibria. In this process the

As Germany prepared for World War I, Britain controlled the seas and thus the access to the natural nitrates in India and Chile that were needed to prepare explosives. Fritz Haber (1868-1934) developed the process to provide a cheaper and more reliable source of explosives. Currently the process is used mainly to produce fertilizers. Large amounts of ammonia are converted into ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate for use as fertilizers.
Approximately 100 pounds of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is used for this purpose per person in the United States each year.

A nighttime photo of a large plant for the commercial production of ammonia, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. Such an installation can produce up to 7000 metric tons of ammonia per day. There are nearly 100 such plants in the world.

In practice, the mixed reactants are compressed by special pumps and injected into the heated reaction vessel.

Figure 17-3 A simplified representation of the Haber process for synthesizing ammonia.

reaction between $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to produce $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is never allowed to reach equilibrium, but moves toward it.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta H^{0}=-92 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \\
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}}=3.6 \times 10^{8} & \left(\text { at } 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)
\end{array}
$$

The process is diagrammed in Figure 17-3. The reaction is carried out at about $450^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ under pressures ranging from 200 to 1000 atmospheres. Hydrogen is obtained from coal gas or petroleum refining and nitrogen is obtained from liquefied air.

The value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ is $3.6 \times 10^{8}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This very large value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ indicates that if equilibrium were reached at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, virtually all of the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ (mixed in a $1: 3$ mole ratio) would be converted into $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. At $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the reaction occurs so slowly, however, that no measurable amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ is produced within a reasonable time. Thus, the large equilibrium constant (a thermodynamic factor) indicates that the reaction proceeds toward the right almost completely. It tells us nothing, however, about how fast the reaction occurs (a kinetic factor).

There are four moles of gas on the left side of the equation and only two moles of gas on the right, so increasing the pressure favors the production of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. The Haber process is therefore carried out at very high pressures, as high as the equipment will safely stand [see Example 17-9(a)].

The reaction is exothermic ( $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is negative), so decreasing the temperature favors the formation of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ [see Example 17-10(b)]. But the rates of both forward and reverse reactions would decrease greatly as the temperature decreases.

A major use of ammonia is as agricultural fertilizer.

only faster but at a lower temperature, which increases the overall production of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and extends the life of the equipment.

Table 17-1 shows the effects of changes in temperature and pressure on the equilibrium yield of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, starting with 1:3 mole ratios of $\mathrm{N}_{2}: \mathrm{H}_{2} . K_{\mathrm{c}}$ changes by more than ten orders of magnitude, from $3.6 \times 10^{8}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to only $1.4 \times 10^{-2}$ at $758^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This tells us that the reaction proceeds very far to the left at high temperatures. Casual examination of the data might suggest that the reaction should be run at lower temperatures so that a higher percentage of the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ would be converted into $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. The reaction occurs so slowly, however, even in the presence of a catalyst, that it cannot be run economically at temperatures below about $450^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

The emerging reaction mixture is cooled down, and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}\left(\mathrm{bp}=-33.43^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is removed as a liquid. This prevents the reaction from reaching equilibrium and favors the forward reaction. The unreacted $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ are recycled. Excess $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ is used to favor the reaction to the right.

## 17-8 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Calculations

We can use equilibrium constants to calculate new equilibrium concentrations that result

Ten orders of magnitude is $10^{10}$, that is,

$$
1 \times 10^{10}=10,000,000,000
$$

It is obvious that adding some HI favors the reaction to the left. If more than one substance is added to the reaction mixture, it might not be obvious which reaction will be favored. Calculating $Q$ always lets us make the decision.

## S top \& Think

Equal amounts of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ must be formed by the new progress of the reaction.

To "consume a negative quantity of $\mathrm{HI}^{\prime \prime}$ would be to form HI . The value $x=-0.25$ would lead to $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]= (0.080+x) M=(0.080-0.25) M= -0.17 M$. A negative concentration is impossible, so $x=-0.25$ is the extraneous root.

## Example 17-11 Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Calculations

Some hydrogen and iodine are mixed at $229^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a 1.00 -liter container. When equilibrium is established, the following concentrations are present: $[\mathrm{HI}]=0.490 M,\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]=0.080 M$, and $\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]=0.060 M$. If an additional 0.300 mol of HI is then added, what concentrations will be present when the new equilibrium is established?

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{HI}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We use the initial equilibrium concentrations to calculate the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. Then we determine the new concentrations after some HI has been added and calculate $Q$. Comparing the value of $Q$ to $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ tells us which reaction is favored. Then we can represent the new equilibrium concentrations. We substitute these representations into the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression and solve for the new equilibrium concentrations.

## Solution

Calculate the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ from the first set of equilibrium concentrations.

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{[\mathrm{HI}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}=\frac{(0.490)^{2}}{(0.080)(0.060)}=50
$$

When we add 0.300 mol of HI to the 1.00-liter container, the [ HI ] instantaneously increases by $0.300 M$.

|  | $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | $+\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons$ | $2 \mathrm{HI}(\mathrm{g})$ |  |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| equilibrium | $0.080 M$ | $0.060 M$ |  | $0.490 M$ |
| mol/L added | $0 M$ | $0 M$ |  | $+0.300 M$ |
| new initial conc'n | $0.080 M$ | $0.060 M$ |  | $0.790 M$ |

Substitution of these new initial concentrations into the reaction quotient gives

$$
Q=\frac{[\mathrm{HI}]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]}=\frac{(0.790)^{2}}{(0.080)(0.060)}=130
$$

Because $Q>K_{c}$, the reaction proceeds to the left to establish a new equilibrium. The new equilibrium concentrations can be determined as follows. Let $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ formed; so $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ formed, and $2 x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of HI consumed.

|  | $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | + | $\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| new initial conc' n | $0.080 M$ | $0.060 M$ | $2 \mathrm{HI}(\mathrm{g})$ |
| change due to rxn | $+x M$ | $+x M$ | $0.790 M$ |
| new equilibrium | $(0.080+x) M$ | $(0.060+x) M$ | $(0.790-2 x) M$ |

Substitution of these values into $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ allows us to evaluate $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{\mathrm{c}}==\frac{(0.790-2 x)^{2}}{(0.080+x)(0.060+x)} & =\frac{0.624-3.16 x+4 x^{2}}{0.0048+0.14 x+x^{2}} \\
0.24+7.0 x+50 x^{2} & =0.624-3.16 x+4 x^{2} \\
46 x^{2}+10.2 x-0.38 & =0
\end{aligned}
$$

Solution by the quadratic formula gives $x=0.032$ and -0.25 .
Clearly, $x=-0.25$ is the extraneous root, because $x$ cannot be less than zero in this case. This reaction does not consume a negative quantity of HI , because the reaction is proceeding toward the left. Thus, $x=0.032$ is the root with physical meaning, so the new equilibrium concentrations are

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right] } & =(0.080+x) M=(0.080+0.032) M=0.112 M \\
{\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right] } & =(0.060+x) M=(0.060+0.032) M=0.092 M
\end{aligned}
$$

In summary,

$\left.\begin{array}{ccc}\text { Original Equilibrium } & \text { Stress Applied } & \text { New Equilibrium } \\ \hline\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]=0.080 \mathrm{M} & & {\left[\begin{array}{r}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]=0.112 \mathrm{M}} \\ {\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]=0.092 \mathrm{M}} \\ {[\mathrm{HI}]=0.726 \mathrm{M}}\end{array}\right.} \\ {[\mathrm{HI}]=0.490 \mathrm{M}}\end{array}\right\} \quad$ Add $0.300 \mathrm{MHI} \quad\left\{\begin{array}{r}{[\mathrm{I}]=0.126} \\ \end{array}\right.$

## You should now work Exercise 64.

We can also use the equilibrium constant to calculate new equilibrium concentrations that result from decreasing the volume (increasing the pressure) of a gaseous system that was initially at equilibrium.

## Example $17-12$ Disturbing a System at Equilibrium: Calculations

At $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ the equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, for the following reaction is $4.66 \times 10^{-3}$. (a) If 0.800 mol of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ were injected into a closed 1.00-liter container at $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, how many moles of each gas would be present at equilibrium? (b) If the volume were then halved (to 0.500 L ) at constant temperature, how many moles of each gas would be present after the new equilibrium has been established?

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]}=4.66 \times 10^{-3}
$$

## Plan

(a) We are given the value of $K_{c}$ and the initial concentration of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$. We write the reaction summary, which gives the representation of the equilibrium concentrations. Then we substitute these into the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression and solve for the new equilibrium concentrations.
(b) We obtain the new initial concentrations by adjusting the equilibrium concentrations from Part (a) for the volume change. Then we solve for the new equilibrium concentrations as we did in Part (a).

## Solution

(a) Let $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ consumed and $2 x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ formed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \\
& \begin{array}{l}
\text { initial } \\
\text { change due to rxn }
\end{array} \begin{array}{rl}
0.800 M & 2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \\
\hline \text { equilibrium } & -x M
\end{array} \\
& \quad(0.800-x) M \\
& \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]}=4.66 \times 10^{-3}=\frac{(2 x)^{2}}{0.800-x}=\frac{4 x^{2}}{0.800-x} \\
& \quad \begin{aligned}
3.73 \times 10^{-3}-4.66 \times 10^{-3} x & =4 x^{2}
\end{aligned} \\
& \quad 4 x^{2}+4.66 \times 10^{-3} x-3.73 \times 10^{-3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving by the quadratic formula gives $x=3.00 \times 10^{-2}$ and $x=-3.11 \times 10^{-2}$. We use $x=3.00 \times 10^{-2}$.

The original equilibrium concentrations are

$$
\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]=2 x M=6.00 \times 10^{-2} M
$$

## S top \& Think

We see that some of the additional HI is consumed, but not all of it. More HI remains after the new equilibrium is established than was present before the stress was imposed. The new equilibrium $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]$ and $\left[\mathrm{I}_{2}\right]$ are substantially greater than the original equilibrium concentrations, however.

The value of $x$ is the number of moles per liter of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ that react. So $x$ must be positive and cannot be greater than 0.800 M .

LeChatelier's Principle tells us that a decrease in volume (increase in pressure) favors the production of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$.

$$

The root $x=0.104$ would give a negative concentration for $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$, which is impossible.

## S top \& Think

The concentrations [ $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ ] and $\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]$ both increase because of the large decrease in volume. However, the number of moles of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ increases, while the number of moles of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ decreases. We predict this from LeChatelier's Principle.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& ? \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2}=1.00 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{6.00 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2}}{\mathrm{~L}}=6.00 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2} \\
& ? \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}=1.00 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{0.770 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}}{\mathrm{~L}}=0.770 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) When the volume of the reaction vessel is halved, the concentrations are doubled, so the new initial concentrations of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ are $2(0.770 \mathrm{M})=1.54 \mathrm{M}$ and $2\left(6.00 \times 10^{-2} M\right)=0.120 M$, respectively.

|  | $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})$ | $\rightleftharpoons$ | $2 \mathrm{NO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :---: |
| new initial | $1.54 M$ |  | $0.120 M$ |
| change due to rxn | $+x M$ |  | $-2 x M$ |
| new equilibrium | $(1.54+x) M$ |  | $(0.120-2 x) M$ |

$$
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]}=4.66 \times 10^{-3}=\frac{(0.120-2 x)^{2}}{1.54+x}
$$

Rearranging into the standard form of a quadratic equation gives

$$
x^{2}-0.121 x+1.81 \times 10^{-3}=0
$$

Solving as before gives $x=0.104$ and $x=0.017$.
The maximum value of $x$ is $0.060 M$, because $2 x$ may not exceed the concentration of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ that was present after the volume was halved. Thus, $x=0.017 M$ is the root with physical significance. The new equilibrium concentrations in the 0.500-liter container are

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right] } & =(0.120-2 x) M=(0.120-0.034) M=0.086 M \\
{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right] } & =(1.54+x) M=(1.54+0.017) M=1.56 M \\
\underline{?} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2} & =0.500 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{0.086 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2}}{\mathrm{~L}}=0.043 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NO}_{2} \\
\underline{?} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4} & =0.500 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{1.56 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}}{\mathrm{~L}}=0.780 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

In summary,

| First Equilibrium | Stress | New Equilibrium |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| 0.770 mol of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ | Decrease volume from | 0.780 mol of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ |
| 0.0600 mol of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ | 1.00 L to 0.500 L | 0.043 mol of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ |

## You should now work Exercise 66.

## Problem-Solving Tip There Are Several Ways to Solve Equilibrium Problems

When a stress is applied to a system originally at equilibrium, it is no longer at equilibrium. As we did in Example 17-12(b), we can apply the stress to the old equilibrium values and then treat these as the new "initial values." Alternatively, we could adjust the original concentration values to reflect the stress, and then treat these as the new "initial values." We could consider $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]_{\text {initial }}$ in Example 17-12(b) as the original 0.800 mol of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ from Part (a) in the new volume, 0.500 L . That is, $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right]_{\text {initial }}=0.800 \mathrm{~mol} / 0.500 \mathrm{~L}=1.60 M$, with no $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ having yet been formed. $\left[\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }}=0 M$. From that starting point, the reaction would proceed to the right.

## 17-9 Partial Pressures and the Equilibrium Constant

It is often more convenient to measure pressures rather than concentrations of gases. Solving the ideal gas equation, $P V=n R T$, for pressure gives

$$
P=\frac{n}{V}(R T) \quad \text { or } \quad P=M(R T)
$$

The pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration ( $n / V$ ). For reactions in which all substances that appear in the equilibrium constant expression are gases, we sometimes prefer to express the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures in atmospheres $\left(\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{P}}\right)$ rather than in terms of concentrations $\left(K_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$.

In general for a reaction involving gases,

$$
a \mathrm{~A}(\mathrm{~g})+b \mathrm{~B}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}(\mathrm{~g})+d \mathrm{D}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{C}}\right)^{c}\left(P_{\mathrm{D}}\right)^{d}}{\left(P_{\mathrm{A}}\right)^{a}\left(P_{\mathrm{B}}\right)^{b}}
$$

For instance, for the following reversible reaction,

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}\right)^{2}}{\left(P_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right)\left(P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\right)^{3}}
$$

## Example 17-13 Calculation of $K_{p}$

In an equilibrium mixture at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we find $P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}=0.147 \mathrm{~atm}, P_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}=6.00 \mathrm{~atm}$, and $P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=3.70 \mathrm{~atm}$. Evaluate $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the following reaction.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We are given equilibrium partial pressures of all reactants and products. So we write the expression for $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ and substitute partial pressures in atmospheres into it.

## Solution

$$
K_{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}\right)^{2}}{\left(P_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right)\left(P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\right)^{3}}=\frac{(0.147)^{2}}{(6.00)(3.70)^{3}}=7.11 \times 10^{-5}
$$

## You should now work Exercises 70 and 73.

## 17-10 Relationship Between $K_{P}$ and $K_{c}$

If the ideal gas equation is rearranged, the molar concentration of a gas is

$$
\left(\frac{n}{V}\right)=\frac{P}{R T} \text { or } M=\frac{P}{R T}
$$

Substituting $P / R T$ for $n / V$ in the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression for the $\mathrm{N}_{2}-\mathrm{H}_{2}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ equilibrium gives the relationship between $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ for this reaction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~N}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2}\right]^{3}} & =\frac{\left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}}{R T}\right)^{2}}{\left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}}{R T}\right)\left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}}{R T}\right)^{3}}=\frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}\right)^{2}}{\left(P_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right)\left(P_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}\right)^{3}} \times \frac{\left(\frac{1}{R T}\right)^{2}}{\left(\frac{1}{R T}\right)^{4}} \\
& =K_{\mathrm{P}}(R T)^{2} \quad \text { or } \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}(R T)^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\left(\frac{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{~V}}\right) \text { is }\left(\frac{\text { no.mol }}{\mathrm{L}}\right)
$$

$K_{\mathrm{p}}$ has no units for the same reasons that $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ has no units.

## S top \& Think

One error that students sometimes make when solving $K_{p}$ problems is to express pressures in torr. Remember that these pressures must be expressed in atmospheres.

## S top \& Think

$\Delta n$ refers to the numbers of moles of gaseous substances in the balanced equation, not in the reaction vessel.

In general the relationship between $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ is

$$
K_{\mathrm{P}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}(\mathrm{RT})^{\Delta n} \quad \text { or } \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=K_{\mathrm{P}}(\mathrm{RT})^{-\Delta n} \quad \Delta n=\left(n_{\text {gas prod }}\right)-\left(n_{\text {gas react }}\right)
$$

For reactions in which equal numbers of moles of gases appear on both sides of the equation, $\Delta n=0$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

In Example 17-1, we saw that for the ammonia reaction at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (or 773 K ), $K_{\mathrm{c}}=0.286$. We can describe this equilibrium in terms of partial pressures using $K_{\mathrm{P}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta n=2-4=-2 \\
& K_{\mathrm{P}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}(R T)^{\Delta n}=(0.286)[(0.0821)(773)]^{-2}=7.10 \times 10^{-5}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is essentially the same value we obtained in Example 17-13.

## Problem-Solving Tip Be Careful About the Value of $R$

To decide which value of $R$ to use when you convert between $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$, you can reason as follows. $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ involves molar concentrations, for which the units are $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L} ; K_{\mathrm{P}}$ involves pressures expressed in atm. Thus the appropriate value of $R$ to use for these conversions must include these units. We use $0.08206 \frac{\mathrm{~L} \cdot \mathrm{~atm}}{\mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}$, rounded to the number of places appropriate to the problem.

For gas-phase reactions, we can calculate the amounts of substances present at equilibrium using either $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{c}}$. The results are the same by either method (when they are both expressed in the same terms). To illustrate, let's solve the following problem by both methods.

## Example 17-14 Calculations with $K_{c}$ and $K_{p}$

We place 10.0 grams of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ in a 5.00 -liter container at $448^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and allow the reaction to attain equilibrium. How many grams of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ are present at equilibrium? Solve this problem (a) using $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and molar concentrations, and (b) using $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ and partial pressures.

$$
\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{SbCl}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=2.51 \times 10^{-2} \quad \text { and } \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=1.48
$$

(a) Plan (using $\boldsymbol{K}_{\boldsymbol{c}}$ )

We calculate the initial concentration of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$, write the reaction summary, and represent the equilibrium concentrations; then we substitute into the $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ expression to obtain the equilibrium concentrations.
(a) Solution (using $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{c}}$ )

Because we are given $K_{\mathrm{c}}$, we use concentrations. The initial concentration of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ is

$$
\left[\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}\right]=\frac{10.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}}{5.00 \mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{299 \mathrm{~g}}=0.00669 M \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}
$$

Let $x=\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ that react. In terms of molar concentrations, the reaction summary is

|  | $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ | $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{SbCl}_{3}$ | + | $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :---: | :---: |
| initial | $0.00669 M$ |  | 0 | 0 |
| change due to rxn | $-x M$ |  | $+x M$ | $+x M$ |
| equilibrium | $(0.00669-x) M$ |  | $x M$ | $x M$ |

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SbCl}_{3}\right]\left[\mathrm{Cl}_{2}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}\right]} \\
2.51 \times 10^{-2}=\frac{(x)(x)}{0.00669-x} \\
x^{2}=1.68 \times 10^{-4}-2.51 \times 10^{-2} x \\
x^{2}+2.51 \times 10^{-2} x-1.68 \times 10^{-4}=0
\end{gathered}
$$

Solving by the quadratic formula gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
x=5.49 \times 10^{-3} \quad \text { and } \quad-3.06 \times 10^{-2}(\text { extraneous root }) \\
{\left[\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}\right]=(0.00669-x) M=(0.00669-0.00549) M=1.20 \times 10^{-3} M} \\
\xrightarrow{?} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}=5.00 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{1.20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{~L}} \times \frac{299 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=1.79 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}
\end{gathered}
$$

Let us now solve the same problem using $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ and partial pressures.

## (b) Plan (using $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{p}}$ )

Calculate the initial partial pressure of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$, and write the reaction summary. Substitution of the representations of the equilibrium partial pressures into $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ gives their values.

## (b) Solution (using $\boldsymbol{K}_{\mathbf{p}}$ )

We calculate the initial pressure of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ in atmospheres, using $P V=n R T$.

$$
P_{\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}}=\frac{n R T}{V}=\frac{\left[(10.0 \mathrm{~g})\left(\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{299 \mathrm{~g}}\right)\right]\left(0.0821 \frac{\mathrm{~L} \cdot \mathrm{~atm}}{\mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}\right)(721 \mathrm{~K})}{5.00 \mathrm{~L}}=0.396 \mathrm{~atm}
$$

Clearly, $P_{\mathrm{SbCl}_{3}}=0$ and $P_{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=0$ because only $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ is present initially. We write the reaction summary in terms of partial pressures in atmospheres, because $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ refers to pressures in atmospheres.

Let $y=$ decrease in pressure (atm) of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ due to reaction. In terms of partial pressures, the reaction summary is

|  | $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$ | $\rightleftharpoons$ | $\mathrm{SbCl}_{3}+$ | $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :---: | ---: |
| initial | 0.396 atm |  | 0 | 0 |
| change due to rxn | $-y \mathrm{~atm}$ |  | $+y \mathrm{~atm}$ | $+y \mathrm{~atm}$ |
| equilibrium | $(0.396-y) \mathrm{atm}$ |  | $y \mathrm{~atm}$ | $y \mathrm{~atm}$ |

$$
\begin{gathered}
K_{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{\left(P_{\mathrm{SbCl}_{3}}\right)\left(P_{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}\right)}{P_{\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}}}=1.48=\frac{(y)(y)}{0.396-y} \\
0.586-1.48 y=y^{2} \quad y^{2}+1.48 y-0.586=0
\end{gathered}
$$

Solving by the quadratic formula gives

$$
\begin{gathered}
y=0.325 \text { and }-1.80 \text { (extraneous root) } \\
P_{\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}}=(0.396-y)=(0.396-0.325)=0.071 \mathrm{~atm}
\end{gathered}
$$

We use the ideal gas law, $P V=n R T$, to calculate the number of moles of $\mathrm{SbCl}_{5}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
n= & \frac{P V}{R T}=\frac{(0.071 \mathrm{~atm})(5.00 \mathrm{~L})}{\left(0.0821 \frac{\mathrm{~L} \cdot \mathrm{~atm}}{\mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}\right)(721 \mathrm{~K})}=0.0060 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5} \\
& \xrightarrow{?} \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}=0.0060 \mathrm{~mol} \times \frac{299 \mathrm{~g}}{\mathrm{~mol}}=1.8 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{SbCl}_{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## You should now work Exercises 75 and 78.

The partial pressure of each substance is proportional to the number of moles of that substance.

If we did not know the value of $K_{\mathrm{p}}$, we could calculate it from the known value of $K_{c}$, using the relationship $K_{\mathrm{P}}=K_{\mathrm{c}}(R T)^{\Delta n}$.

We see that within roundoff range the same result is obtained by both methods.

The decomposition reaction
$$
2 \mathrm{HgO}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Hg}(\ell)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

The reaction is not at equilibrium here, because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas has been allowed to escape.

## S top \& Think

Remember that concentrations or pressures for pure liquids and pure solids do not appear in the equilibrium constant expressions.

## 17-11 Heterogeneous Equilibria

Thus far, we have considered only equilibria involving species in a single phase, that is, homogeneous equilibria. Heterogeneous equilibria involve species in more than one phase. Consider the following reversible reaction at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

$$
2 \mathrm{HgO}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Hg}(\ell)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

A solid, a liquid, and a gas are all present when equilibrium is established for this system. Neither solids nor liquids are significantly affected by changes in pressure. The fundamental definition of the equilibrium constant in thermodynamics is in terms of the activities of the substances involved.

For any pure solid or pure liquid, the activity is taken as 1 (Section 17-2), so terms for pure liquids and pure solids do not appear in the $K$ expressions for heterogeneous equilibria.

Thus, for the reaction

$$
2 \mathrm{HgO}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{Hg}(\ell)+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad K_{\mathrm{c}}=\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right] \quad \text { and } \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}
$$

These equilibrium constant expressions indicate that equilibrium exists at a given temperature for one and only one concentration and one partial pressure of oxygen in contact with liquid mercury and solid mercury(II) oxide.

## Example 17-15 $K_{c}$ and $K_{p}$ for Heterogeneous Equilibrium

Write both $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ for the following reversible reactions.
(a) $2 \mathrm{ZnS}(\mathrm{s})+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{ZnO}(\mathrm{s})+2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$
(b) $2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\ell) \rightleftharpoons\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\mathrm{~s})$
(c) $\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})$

## Plan

We apply the definitions of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ to each reaction.

## Solution

(a) $K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{SO}_{2}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]^{3}} \quad K_{\mathrm{p}}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{SO}_{2}}\right)^{2}}{\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{3}}$
(b) $K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{1}{\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{2}}=\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]^{-2} \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{1}{\left(P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}\right)^{2}}=\left(P_{\mathrm{NH}_{3}}\right)^{-2}$
(c) $K_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{3}\right]} \quad K_{\mathrm{P}}$ undefined; no gases involved

## Example 17-16 Heterogeneous Equilibria

The value of $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ is 27 for the thermal decomposition of potassium chlorate at a given high temperature. What is the partial pressure of oxygen in a closed container in which the following system is at equilibrium at the given temperature? (This can be a dangerous reaction.)

$$
2 \mathrm{KClO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s}) \stackrel{\text { heat }}{\rightleftharpoons} 2 \mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

Because two solids, $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}$ and KCl , and only one gas, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, are involved, we see that $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ involves only the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, that is, $K_{\mathrm{P}}=\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{3}$.

## Solution

We are given

$$
K_{\mathrm{P}}=\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{3}=27
$$

Let $x \mathrm{~atm}=P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at equilibrium. Then we have

$$
\left(P_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)^{3}=27=x^{3} \quad x=3.0 \mathrm{~atm}
$$

This tells us that the partial pressure of oxygen at equilibrium is 3.0 atm .
You should now work Exercises 80 and 91.

## 17-12 Relationship Between $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ and the Equilibrium Constant

Let's consider in thermodynamic terms what may happen when two substances are mixed together at constant temperature and pressure. First, as a result of mixing, there is usually an increase in entropy due to the increase in disorder. If the two substances can react with each other, the chemical reaction begins, heat is released or absorbed, and the concentrations of the substances in the mixture change. An additional change in entropy, which depends on changes in the nature of the reactants and products, also begins to occur. The evolution or absorption of heat energy, the changes in entropy, and the changes in concentrations all continue until equilibrium is established. Equilibrium may be reached with large amounts of products formed, with virtually all of the reactants remaining unchanged, or at any intermediate combination of concentrations.

The standard free energy change for a reaction is $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$. This is the free energy change that would accompany complete conversion of all reactants initially present at standard conditions to all products at standard conditions-the standard reaction (Section 15-15). The free energy change for any other concentrations or pressures is $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ (no superscript zero). The two quantities are related by the equation

$$
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}=\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}+R T \ln Q
$$

$R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient. When a system is at equilibrium, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=0$ (Section 15-15) and $Q=K$. Recall that the reaction quotient may represent nonequilibrium concentrations (or partial pressures) of products and reactants. As reaction occurs, the free energy of the mixture and the concentrations change until at equilibrium $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}=0$, and the concentrations of reactants and products satisfy the equilibrium constant. At that point, $Q$ becomes equal to $K$ (Section 17-4). Then

$$
0=\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}+R T \ln K \quad \text { (at equilibrium) }
$$

Rearranging gives

$$
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-R T \ln K
$$

This equation shows the relationship between the standard free energy change and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant.

For the following generalized reaction, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant is defined in terms of the activities of the species involved.

$$
a \mathrm{~A}+b \mathrm{~B} \rightleftharpoons c \mathrm{C}+d \mathrm{D} \quad K=\frac{\left(a_{\mathrm{C}}\right)^{c}\left(a_{\mathrm{D}}\right)^{d}}{\left(a_{*}\right)^{a}\left(a_{\mathrm{n}}\right)^{b}}
$$

Thermodynamic standard states are (1) pure solids or pure liquids at 1 atm, (2) solutions of one-molar concentrations, and (3) gases at partial pressures of 1 atm .

## S top \& Think

The energy units of $R$ must match those of $\Delta G^{0}$. We usually use

$$
R=8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
$$

We will encounter equilibrium calculations for solution and gaseous species in electrochemistry (Chapter 21).
where $a_{\mathrm{A}}$ is the activity of substance A , and so on (Section 17-2). The mass action expression to which it is related involves concentration terms for species in solution and partial pressures for gases.

When the relationship $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-R T \ln K$ is used with

1. all gaseous reactants and products, $K$ represents $K_{\mathrm{P}}$;
2. all solution reactants and products, $K$ represents $K_{c}$;
3. a mixture of solution and gaseous reactants, $K$ represents the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, and we do not make the distinction between $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ and $K_{\mathrm{c}}$.

Figure 17-4 displays the relationships between free energy and equilibrium. The left end of each curve represents the total free energy of the reactants and the right end of each curve represents the total free energy of the products at standard state conditions. The difference between them is $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$; like $K, \Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ depends only on temperature and is a constant for any given reaction.

From the preceding equation that relates $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ and $K$, we see that when $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is negative, $\ln K$ must be positive, and $K$ is greater than 1 . This tells us that products are favored over reactants at equilibrium. This case is illustrated in Figure 17-4a. When $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is positive, $\ln K$ must be negative, and $K$ is less than 1 . This tells us that reactants are favored over products at equilibrium (Figure 17-4b). In the rare case of a chemical reaction for which $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=0$, then $K=1$ and the numerator and the denominator must be equal in

Active Figure 17-4 Variation in total free energy for a reversible reaction carried out at constant $T$. The standard free energy change, $\Delta G^{0}$, represents the free energy change for the standard reactionthe complete conversion of reactants into products (both at standard state concentrations: 1 M or 1 atm). In (a) this change is negative, indicating that the standard reaction is product-favored (spontaneous); the collection of just products would be more stable than the collection of just reactants. The mixture of reactants and products corresponding to the minimum of the curve is even more stable, however, and represents the equilibrium mixture. Because $\Delta G^{0}$ is negative, $K>1$, and the equilibrium mixture is richer in products than in reactants. At any point on the curve, comparing $Q$ and $K$ indicates the direction in which the reaction must proceed to approach equilibrium, that is, which way is "downhill" in free energy. The plot in (b) is for positive $\Delta G^{0}$ (the standard reaction is reactant-favored). In this case $K<1$, and the equilibrium mixture is richer in reactants than in products.

the equilibrium constant expression (i.e., $[\mathrm{C}]^{c}[\mathrm{D}]^{d \ldots}=[\mathrm{A}]^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]^{b} \ldots$ ). These relationships are summarized as follows.

| $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{G}_{\mathbf{r x n}}^{\mathbf{0}}$ | $\boldsymbol{K}$ | Product Formation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}<0$ | $K>1$ | Products favored over reactants at equilibrium |
| $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=0$ | $K=1$ | At equilibrium when $[\mathrm{C}]^{c}[\mathrm{D}]^{d} \ldots=[\mathrm{A}]^{a}[\mathrm{~B}]^{b} \ldots$ (very rare) |
| $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}>0$ | $K<1$ | Reactants favored over products at equilibrium |

The direction of approach to equilibrium and the actual free energy change ( $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}$ ) are not constants. They vary with the conditions and the initial concentrations. If the initial concentrations correspond to $Q<\mathrm{K}$, equilibrium is approached from left to right on the curves in Figure 17-4, and the forward reaction predominates. If $Q>K$, equilibrium is approached from right to left, and the reverse reaction predominates.

The magnitude of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ indicates the extent to which a chemical reaction occurs under standard state conditions, that is, how far the reaction goes toward the formation of products before equilibrium is reached. The more negative the $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ value, the larger is the value of $K$ and the more favorable is the formation of products. We think of some reactions as going "to completion." These generally have very negative $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ values. The more positive the $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ value, the smaller is the value of $K$ and the less favorable is the formation of products.

## Example 17-17 $K$ Versus $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$

Use the data in Appendix K to calculate $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ for the following reaction at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

$$
2 \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

The temperature is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, so we evaluate $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ for the reaction from $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ values in Appendix K . The reaction involves only gases, so $K$ is $K_{\mathrm{p}}$. This means that $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}}$. We solve for $K_{\mathrm{P}}$.

## Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =\left[2 \Delta G_{\mathrm{fN}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{fO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0}\right]-\left[2 \Delta G_{\mathrm{fN}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0}\right] \\
& =[2(0)+0]-[2(104.2)]=-208.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}, \text { or }-2.084 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a gas-phase reaction, so $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is related to $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}} \\
\ln K_{\mathrm{P}} & =\frac{\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}}{-R T}=\frac{-2.084 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}}{-(8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K})(298 \mathrm{~K})}=84.1 \\
K_{\mathrm{P}} & =e^{84.1}=3.3 \times 10^{36}
\end{aligned}
$$

The very large value of $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ tells us that the equilibrium lies very far to the right. This reaction is so slow at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, however, that very little $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ decomposes to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at that temperature.

## You should now work Exercise 84.

## Example 17-18 $K$ Versus $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$

In Examples 15-19 and 15-20 we evaluated $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ for the following reaction at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and found it to be $+173.1 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. Calculate $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for this reaction.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## S top \& Think

Remember (Section 15-16) that if the temperature is not $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, you must calculate $\Delta G^{0}$ for the reaction from the equation

$$
\Delta G^{0}=\Delta H^{0}-T \Delta S^{0}
$$

using tabulated values of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ and $S^{0}$ as given in Appendix K. Review Examples 15-19 and 15-20.

Units cancel when we express $\Delta G^{0}$ in joules per mole. We interpret this as meaning "per mole of reaction"that is, for the number of moles of each substance shown in the balanced equation.

On some calculators, we evaluate $e^{x}$ as follows: Enter the value of $x$, then press INV followed by $\ln x$.

## S top \& Think

The energy units in $\Delta G$, often given in kJ , must be converted to J to match those of $R$.

Compare the form of this equation to the Arrhenius equation (Section 16-8) and to the ClausiusClapeyron equation (Section 13-9).

## Plan

In this example we use $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}}$.

## Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}} \\
\ln K_{\mathrm{P}} & =\frac{\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}}{-R T}=\frac{1.731 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}}{-(8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K})(298 \mathrm{~K})} \\
& =-69.9 \\
K_{\mathrm{P}} & =e^{-69.9}=4.4 \times 10^{-31}
\end{aligned}
$$

This very small number indicates that at equilibrium almost no $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are converted to NO at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For all practical purposes, the reaction does not occur at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

## You should now work Exercise 86.

A very important application of the relationships in this section is the use of measured $K$ values to calculate $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$.

## Example 17-19 K Versus $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$

The equilibrium constant, $K_{\mathrm{P}}$, for the following reaction is $5.04 \times 10^{17}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Calculate $\Delta G_{298}^{0}$ for the hydrogenation of ethylene to form ethane.

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We use the relationship between $\Delta G^{0}$ and $K_{\mathrm{P}}$.

## Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{298}^{0} & =-R T \ln K_{\mathrm{P}} \\
& =-(8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K})(298 \mathrm{~K}) \ln \left(5.04 \times 10^{17}\right) \\
& =-1.01 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \\
& =-101 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}
\end{aligned}
$$

## You should now work Exercise 88(a).

## 17-13 Evaluation of Equilibrium Constants at Different Temperatures

Chemists have determined equilibrium constants for thousands of reactions. It would be an impossibly huge task to catalog such constants at every temperature of interest for each reaction. Fortunately, there is no need to do this. If we determine the equilibrium constant, $K_{T_{1}}$, for a reaction at one temperature, $T_{1}$, and also its $\Delta H^{0}$, we can then estimate the equilibrium constant at a second temperature, $T_{2}$, using the van't Hoff equation.

$$
\ln \left(\frac{K_{T_{2}}}{K_{T_{1}}}\right)=\frac{\Delta H^{0}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}-\frac{1}{T_{2}}\right)
$$

Thus, if we know $\Delta H^{0}$ for a reaction and $K$ at a given temperature (say 298 K ), we can use the van't Hoff equation to calculate the value of $K$ at any other temperature.

## Example 17-20 Evaluation of $K_{\mathrm{p}}$ at Different Temperatures

We found in Example 17-18 that $K_{\mathrm{P}}=4.4 \times 10^{-31}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$ for the following reaction. $\Delta H^{0}=180.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ for this reaction. Evaluate $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ at 2400. K.

$$
\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

## Plan

We are given $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ at one temperature, $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the value of $\Delta H^{0}$. We are given the second temperature, 2400 K . These data allow us to evaluate the right side of the van't Hoff equation, which gives us $\ln \left(K_{T_{2}} / K_{T_{1}}\right)$. Because we know $K_{T_{1}}$, we can find the value for $K_{T_{2}}$.

## Solution

Let $T_{1}=298 \mathrm{~K}$ and $T_{2}=2400 \mathrm{~K}$. Then

$$
\ln \left(\frac{K_{T_{2}}}{K_{T_{1}}}\right)=\frac{\Delta H^{0}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{1}}-\frac{1}{T_{2}}\right)
$$

Let us first evaluate the right side of the equation.

$$
\ln \left(\frac{K_{T_{2}}}{K_{T_{1}}}\right)=\frac{1.805 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol}}{8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}\left(\frac{1}{298 \mathrm{~K}}-\frac{1}{2400 . \mathrm{K}}\right)=63.8
$$

Now take the inverse logarithm of both sides.

$$
\frac{K_{T_{2}}}{K_{T_{1}}}=e^{63.8}=5.1 \times 10^{27}
$$

Solving for $K_{T_{2}}$ and substituting the known value of $K_{T_{1}}$, we obtain

$$
K_{T_{2}}=\left(5.1 \times 10^{27}\right)\left(K_{T_{1}}\right)=\left(5.1 \times 10^{27}\right)\left(4.4 \times 10^{-31}\right)=2.2 \times 10^{-3} \text { at } 2400 . \mathrm{K}
$$

You should now work Exercise 88(b-f).

## Problem-Solving Tip Use the Correct K

The $K$ values that appear in the van't Hoff equation represent the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (Section 17-12). For a gas-phase reaction (such as that in Example 17-20), $K$ represents $K_{\mathrm{P}}$; if the value of $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ were given, we would have to convert it to $K_{\mathrm{P}}$ (Section 17-10) before using the van't Hoff equation.

In Example 17-20 we see that $K_{T_{2}}\left(K_{\mathrm{P}}\right.$ at 2400 K$)$ is quite small, which tells us that the equilibrium favors $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ rather than NO . Nevertheless, $K_{T_{2}}$ is very much larger than $K_{T_{1}}$, which is $4.4 \times 10^{-31}$. At 2400 K , significantly more NO is present at equilibrium relative to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than at 298 K . So automobiles emit small amounts of NO into the atmosphere that are sufficient to cause severe air pollution problems. Catalytic converters (Section 16-9) are designed to catalyze the breakdown of NO into $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

$$
2 \mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{~g}) \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

This reaction is spontaneous. Catalysts do not shift the position of equilibrium. They favor neither consumption nor production of NO. They merely allow the system to reach equilibrium more rapidly. The time factor is very important because the NO stays in the automobile exhaust system for only a very short time.

2400 K is a typical temperature inside the combustion chambers of automobile engines. Large quantities of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are present during gasoline combustion because the gasoline is mixed with air.

## S top \& Think

The positive value of $\Delta H^{0}$ tells us that the reaction is endothermic. Thus, it is reasonable that the equilibrium constant is greater ( $2.2 \times 10^{-3}$ compared to $4.4 \times 10^{-31}$ ) at the higher temperature of 2400 . K.

The $K_{\mathrm{p}}$ value could be converted to $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ using the relationship $K_{\mathrm{c}}=K_{\mathrm{p}}(R T)^{-\Delta n}$ (Section 17-10).
