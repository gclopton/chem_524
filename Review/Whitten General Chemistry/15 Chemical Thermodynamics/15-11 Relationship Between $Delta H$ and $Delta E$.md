# 15-11 Relationship Between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta E$

The fundamental definition of enthalpy, $H$, is

> [!equation] Enthalpy (definition)
> $$
> H=E+P V
> $$

For a process at constant temperature and pressure,

> [!equation] Enthalpy change vs. internal energy change (constant $T$, $P$)
> $$
> \Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
> $$

From Section 15-10, we know that $\Delta E=q+w$, so

$$
\Delta H=q+w+P \Delta V \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

At constant pressure, $w=-P \Delta V$, so

$$
\Delta H=q+(-P \Delta V)+P \Delta V
$$

> [!equation] Enthalpy change equals heat at constant pressure
> $$
> \Delta H=q_{p} \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
> $$

The difference between $\Delta E$ and $\Delta H$ is the amount of expansion work ( $P \Delta V$ work) that the system can do. Unless there is a change in the number of moles of gas present, this difference is extremely small and can usually be neglected. For an ideal gas, $P V=n R T$. At constant temperature and constant pressure, $P \Delta V=(\Delta n) R T$, a work term. Substituting gives

> [!equation] $\Delta H$–$\Delta E$ relation for reactions involving gases (ideal gas, constant $T$, $P$)
> $$
> \Delta H=\Delta E+(\Delta n) R T \quad \text { or } \quad \Delta E=\Delta H-(\Delta n) R T \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
> $$

> When a chemical reaction occurs and causes a change in the number of moles of gas, it is more convenient to use the relationship in the form $\Delta H=\Delta E+(\Delta n) R T$. You should always remember that $\Delta n$ refers to the change in the number of moles of gas in the balanced chemical equation.

In Example 15-14 we found that the change in internal energy, $\Delta E$, for the combustion of ethanol is $-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ ethanol at 298 K . Combustion of one mole of ethanol at 298 K and constant pressure releases 1367 kJ of heat. Therefore (Section 15-5)

$$
\Delta H=-1367 \frac{\mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{~mol} \text { ethanol }}
$$

The difference between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta E$ is due to the work term, $-P \Delta V$ or $-(\Delta n) R T$. In this balanced equation there are fewer moles of gaseous products than of gaseous reactants: $\Delta n=2-3=-1$.

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

Thus, the atmosphere does work on the system (compresses it). Let us find the work done on the system per mole of reaction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
w & =-P \Delta V=-(\Delta n) R T \\
& =-(-1 \mathrm{~mol})\left(\frac{8.314 \mathrm{~J}}{\mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}\right)(298 \mathrm{~K})=+2.48 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} \\
w & =+2.48 \mathrm{~kJ} \quad \text { or } \quad(\Delta n) R T=-2.48 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can now calculate $\Delta E$ for the reaction from $\Delta H$ and $(\Delta n) R T$ values.

$$
\Delta E=\Delta H-(\Delta n) R T=[-1367-(-2.48)]=-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

This value agrees with the result that we obtained in Example 15-14. The size of the work term ( +2.48 kJ ) is very small compared with $\Delta H(-1367 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn})$. This is true for many reactions. Of course, if $\Delta n=0$, then $\Delta H=\Delta E$, and the same amount of heat would be absorbed or given off by the reaction whether it is carried out at constant pressure or at constant volume.

**Spontaneity of Physical and Chemical Changes**

Another major concern of thermodynamics is predicting whether a particular process can occur under specified conditions to give predominantly products. We may summarize this concern in the question "Which would be more stable at the given conditions-the reactants or the products?" A change for which the collection of products is thermodynamically more stable than the collection of reactants under the given conditions is said to be product-favored, or spontaneous, under those conditions. A change for which the products are thermodynamically less stable than the reactants under the given conditions is described as reactant-favored, or nonspontaneous, under those conditions. Some changes are spontaneous under all conditions; others are nonspontaneous under all conditions. The great majority of changes, however, are spontaneous under some conditions but not under others. We use thermodynamics to predict conditions for which the latter type of reactions can occur to give predominantly products.

The concept of spontaneity has a specific interpretation in thermodynamics. A spontaneous chemical reaction or physical change is one that can happen without any continuing outside influence. Examples are the loss of heat by a hot metal to its cooler surroundings, the rusting of a piece of iron, the expansion of a gas into a larger volume, or the melting of ice at room temperature. Such changes have a tendency to occur without being driven by an external influence. We can think of a spontaneous process as one for which products are favored over reactants at the specified conditions. The reverse of each of the spontaneous changes just listed is nonspontaneous at the same conditions, that is, it does not occur naturally. We can, however, cause some nonspontaneous changes to occur. For example, forcing an electric current through a block of metal can heat it to a temperature higher than that of its surroundings. We can compress a gas into a smaller volume by pressing on it with a piston. But to cause a process to occur in its nonspontaneous direction, we must influence it from outside the system; that is, work must be done on the system.

Although a spontaneous reaction might occur rapidly, thermodynamic spontaneity is not related to speed. The fact that a process is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable rate. It may occur rapidly, at a moderate rate, or very slowly. The rate at which a spontaneous reaction occurs is addressed by kinetics (Chapter 16).

We now study the factors that influence spontaneity of a physical or chemical change.
