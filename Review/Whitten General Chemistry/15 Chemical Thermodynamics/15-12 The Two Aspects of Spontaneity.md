# 15-12 The Two Aspects of Spontaneity

Many product-favored reactions are exothermic. For instance, the combustion (burning) reactions of hydrocarbons such as methane and octane are all exothermic and highly product-favored (spontaneous). The total enthalpy content of the products is lower than that of the reactants. Not all exothermic changes are spontaneous, however, nor are all spontaneous changes exothermic. As an example, consider the freezing of water, which is an exothermic process (heat is released). This process is spontaneous at temperatures below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but we know it is not spontaneous at temperatures above $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Likewise, we know there are conditions at which the melting of ice, an endothermic

The positive sign for $w$ is consistent with the fact that work is done on the system. The balanced equation involves one mole of ethanol, so this is the amount of work done when one mole of ethanol undergoes combustion.

> Figure 15-10 The diffusion of two gases into one another is spontaneous. (a) A sample of gas in which all molecules of one gas are in one bulb and all molecules of the other gas are in the other bulb. (b) A sample of gas that contains the same number of each kind of molecule as in (a), but with the two kinds randomly mixed in the two bulbs. Sample (b) has greater dispersal of both matter and energy, and is thus more probable.

Recall that the temperature of a sample is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles.
process, is spontaneous. Spontaneity is favored but not required when heat is released during a chemical reaction or a physical change.

There is another factor that also plays a fundamental role in determining spontaneity. Let's think about two spontaneous processes. Figure 15-10 shows what happens when two gas samples at the same pressure are allowed to mix. The molecules move randomly throughout the two containers to mix the gases (a spontaneous process). We don't expect the more homogeneous sample in Figure 15-10b to spontaneously "unmix" to give the arrangement in Figure 15-10a (a nonspontaneous process).

> A hot piece of metal is placed into cooler water. Heat is transferred spontaneously from the hotter metal to the cooler water, until the two are at the same temperature (the condition of thermal equilibrium).
> 
> As a hot metal cools, some of the energy of its vibrating atoms is transferred to the surroundings (a spontaneous process). This warms the surroundings until the two temperatures are equal. We do not expect to observe the reverse process in which energy is transferred from the surroundings to a block of metal, originally at the same temperature, to raise the temperature of the metal (a nonspontaneous process).

In these examples, we see that energy and matter tend to become dispersed (spread out). We shall see that this dispersal is a fundamental driving force that affects the spontaneity of any process.

Two factors affect the spontaneity of any physical or chemical change:

1. Spontaneity is favored when heat is released during the change (exothermic).
2. Spontaneity is favored when the change causes an increase in the dispersal of energy and matter.

The balance of these two effects is considered in Section 15-16.
