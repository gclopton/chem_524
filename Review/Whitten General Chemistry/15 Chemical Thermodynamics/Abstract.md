# Abstract

At temperatures above 145 K , the $T \Delta S^{0}$ term would be greater ( $-T \Delta S^{0}$ would be more negative) than the $\Delta H^{0}$ term, which would make $\Delta G^{0}$ negative; so the reaction would be producd-favored above 145 K . At temperatures below 145 K , the $T \Delta S^{0}$ term would be smaller than the $\Delta H^{0}$ term, which would make $\Delta G^{0}$ positive; so the reaction would be reactant-favored below 145 K .

However, $145 \mathrm{~K}\left(-128^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is a very low temperature. For all practical purposes, the reaction is product-favored at all but very low temperatures. In practice, it is carried out at $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because of the greater reaction rate at these higher temperatures. This gives a useful and economical rate of production of $\mathrm{SiCl}_{4}$, an important industrial chemical.
