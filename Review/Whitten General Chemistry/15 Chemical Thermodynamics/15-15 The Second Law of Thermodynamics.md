# 15-15 The Second Law of Thermodynamics

We now know that two factors determine whether a reaction is spontaneous under a given set of conditions. The effect of the first factor, the enthalpy change, is that spontaneity is favored (but not required) by exothermicity, and nonspontaneity is favored (but not required) by endothermicity. The effect of the other factor is summarized by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

In any spontaneous change, the universe tends toward a state of increasing entropy, $\Delta S_{\text {universe }}>0$.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is based on our experiences, as seen by the following examples. Gases mix spontaneously. When a drop of food coloring is added to a glass of water, it diffuses until a homogeneously colored solution results. When a truck is driven down the street, it consumes fuel and oxygen, producing carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other emitted substances.

The reverse of any spontaneous change is nonspontaneous, because if it did occur, the universe would tend toward a state of lower entropy (greater order, more concentration of energy). This is contrary to our experience. A gas mixture does not spontaneously separate into its components. A colored solution does not spontaneously concentrate all of its color in a small volume. A truck cannot be driven along the street, even in reverse gear, so that it sucks up $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, water vapor, and other substances to produce fuel and oxygen.

If the entropy of a system increases during a process, the spontaneity of the process is favored but not required. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that the entropy of the universe (not the system) increases during a spontaneous process, that is,

> [!equation] Second law (entropy change of the universe)
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}+\Delta S_{\text {surroundings }}>0 \quad \text { (spontaneous process) }
> $$

Of the two ideal gas samples in Figure 15-10, the more ordered arrangement (Figure 15-10a) has lower entropy than the randomly mixed arrangement with the same volume (Figure 15-10b). Because these ideal gas samples mix without absorbing or releasing heat and without a change in total volume, they do not interact with the surroundings, so the entropy of the surroundings does not change. In this case

> [!equation] Special case: $\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}}=0$
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}
> $$

If we open the stopcock between the two bulbs in Figure 15-10a, we expect the gases to mix spontaneously, with an increase in the disorder of the system, that is, $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$ is positive.

$$
\text { unmixed gases ⟶ mixed gases } \quad \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}>0
$$

We do not expect the more homogeneous sample in Figure 15-10b to spontaneously "unmix" to give the arrangement in Figure 15-10a (which would correspond to a decrease in $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$ ).

$$
\text { mixed gases } \longrightarrow \text { unmixed gases } \quad \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}<0
$$

The entropy of a system can decrease during a spontaneous process or increase during a nonspontaneous process, depending on the accompanying $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$. If $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative (decrease in disorder), then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ may still be positive (overall increase in disorder) if $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is more positive than $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative. A refrigerator provides an illustration. It removes heat from inside the box (the system) and ejects that heat, plus the heat generated by the compressor, into the room (the surroundings). The entropy of the system decreases because the air molecules inside the box move more slowly. But the increase in the entropy of the surroundings more than makes up for that, so the entropy of the universe (refrigerator + room) increases.

Similarly, if $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is positive but $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is even more negative, then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is still negative. Such a process will be nonspontaneous.

Let's consider the entropy changes that occur when a liquid solidifies at a temperature below its freezing (melting) point (Figure 15-20a). $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative because a solid forms from its liquid, yet we know that this is a spontaneous process. A liquid releases heat to its surroundings (atmosphere) as it crystallizes. The released heat increases the motion (more disorder, greater dispersal of matter) of the molecules of the surroundings, so $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is positive. As the temperature decreases, the $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ contribution becomes more important. When the temperature is low enough (below the freezing point), the positive $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ outweighs the negative $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. Then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ becomes positive, and the freezing process becomes spontaneous.

The situation is reversed when a liquid is boiled or a solid is melted (Figure 15-20b). For example, at temperatures above its melting point, a solid spontaneously melts, the system becomes more disordered (greater dispersal of matter), and $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is positive. The heat absorbed when the solid (system) melts comes from its surroundings. This decreases the motion of the molecules of the surroundings. Thus, $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is negative (the surroundings become less disordered). The positive $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is greater in magnitude than the negative $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$, however, so $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive and the process is spontaneous.

Above the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for melting. Below the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for freezing. At the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. Then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is zero for both melting and freezing; the system is at equilibrium. Table 15-6 lists the entropy effects for these changes of physical state.

We have said that $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for all spontaneous (product-favored) processes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make direct measurements of $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ Consequently, entropy changes accompanying physical and chemical changes are reported in terms of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. The subscript "sys" for system is usually omitted. The symbol $\Delta S$ refers to the change in entropy of the reacting system, just as $\Delta H$ refers to the change in enthalpy of the reacting system.

We abbreviate these subscripts as follows: system = sys, surroundings = surr, and universe = univ.

Can you develop a comparable table for boiling (liquid → gas) and condensation (gas → liquid)? (Study Table 15-6 carefully.)
