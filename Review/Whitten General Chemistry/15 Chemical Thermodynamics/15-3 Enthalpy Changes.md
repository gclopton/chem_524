# 15-3 Enthalpy Changes

Most chemical reactions and physical changes occur at constant (usually atmospheric) pressure.

The quantity of heat transferred into or out of a system as it undergoes a chemical or physical change at constant pressure, $q_{\mathrm{p}}$, is defined as the enthalpy change, $\Delta \boldsymbol{H}$, of the process.

An enthalpy change is sometimes loosely referred to as a heat change or a heat of reaction. The enthalpy change is equal to the enthalpy or "heat content," $H$, of the substances produced minus the enthalpy of the substances consumed.

It is impossible to know the absolute enthalpy (heat content) of a system. Enthalpy is a state function, however, and it is the change in enthalpy in which we are interested; this can be measured for many processes. In the next several sections, we focus on chemical reactions and the enthalpy changes that occur in these processes. We first discuss the experimental determination of enthalpy changes.
