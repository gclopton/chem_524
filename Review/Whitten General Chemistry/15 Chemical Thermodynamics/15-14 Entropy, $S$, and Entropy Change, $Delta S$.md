# 15-14 Entropy, $S$, and Entropy Change, $\Delta S$

The dispersal of energy and matter is described by the thermodynamic state function entropy, $\boldsymbol{S}$. In the most fundamental description, the greater the energy dispersal in a system, the higher is its entropy. We have said that greater disorder (dispersal of matter, both in space and in variety) can lead to greater dispersal of energy, and hence to higher entropy. This connection allows us to discuss many entropy changes in terms of increases or decreases in the disorder and the energy dispersal of the system. Let us first see how entropy is tabulated and how entropy changes are calculated.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics establishes the zero of the entropy scale.

> The entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance (perfectly ordered) is zero at absolute zero ( 0 K ).

As the temperature of a substance increases, the particles vibrate more vigorously, so the entropy increases (Figure 15-15). Further heat input causes either increased temperature (still higher entropy) or phase transitions (melting, sublimation, or boiling) that also result in higher entropy. The entropy of a substance at any condition is its absolute entropy, also called standard molar entropy. Consider the absolute entropies at 298 K listed in Table 15-4. At 298 K , any substance is more disordered than if it were in a perfect crystalline state at absolute zero, so tabulated $S_{298}^{0}$ values for compounds and elements are always positive. Notice especially that $S_{298}^{0}$ of an element, unlike its $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$, is not equal to zero. The reference state for absolute entropy is specified by the Third Law of Thermodynamics. It is different from the reference state for $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ (Section 15-7). The absolute entropies, $S_{298}^{0}$, of various substances under standard conditions are tabulated in Appendix K.

Just as for other thermodynamic quantities, the entropy change for a system, $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$, is the difference between final and initial states:

> [!equation] Entropy change (definition)
> $$
> \Delta S_{\text {system }}=S_{\text {system, final }}-S_{\text {system, initial }}
> $$

The standard entropy change, $\Delta \boldsymbol{S}^{0}$, of a reaction can be determined from the absolute entropies of reactants and products. The relationship is analogous to Hess's Law.

> \Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\Sigma n S_{\text {products }}^{0}-\Sigma n S_{\text {reactants }}^{0}

> Figure 15-15 (a) A simplified representation of a side view of a "perfect" crystal of a polar substance at 0 K . Note the perfect alignment of the dipoles in all molecules in a perfect crystal. This causes its entropy to be zero at 0 K . There are no perfect crystals, however, because even the purest substances that scientists have prepared are contaminated by traces of impurities that occupy a few of the positions in the crystal structure. Additionally, there are some vacancies in the crystal structures of even very highly purified substances such as those used in semiconductors (Section 13-17). (b) A simplified representation of the same "perfect" crystal at a temperature above 0 K . Vibrations of the individual molecules within the crystal cause some dipoles to be oriented in directions other than those in a perfect arrangement. The entropy of such a crystalline solid is greater than zero because there is disorder in the crystal. Many different arrangements are possible for such a disordered array,

$S^{0}$ values are tabulated in units of $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ rather than the larger units involving kilojoules that are used for enthalpy changes. The "mol" term in the units for a substance refers to a mole of the substance, whereas for a reaction it refers to a mole of reaction. Each term in the sums on the right-hand side of the equation has the units

$$
\frac{\text { mol substance }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \times \frac{\mathrm{J}}{(\mathrm{~mol} \text { substance }) \cdot \mathrm{K}}=\frac{\mathrm{J}}{(\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}) \cdot \mathrm{K}}
$$

The result is usually abbreviated as $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, or sometimes even as $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{K}$. As before, we will usually omit units in intermediate steps and then apply appropriate units to the result.

We now illustrate this calculation for a phase change and for a chemical reaction.

**Plan**

We use the equation for standard entropy change to calculate $\Delta S^{0}$ from the tabulated values of standard molar entropies, $S^{0}$, for the final and initial states shown in the process.

**Solution**

We list the $\Delta S_{298}^{0}$ values from Appendix K:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \quad \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \\
& S^{0}, \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}: \quad 152.2 \quad 245.4 \\
& \begin{aligned}
\Delta S^{0} & =\Sigma n S_{\text {products }}^{0}-\Sigma n S_{\text {reactants }}^{0} \\
& =1(245.4)-1(152.2)=93.2 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

The "mol" designation for $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ refers to a mole of reaction. The reaction as written shows one mole of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$, so this is the entropy change for the vaporization of one mole of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$. It can be called the molar entropy of vaporization of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

> In this reaction, liquid reactants are converted into a larger number of moles of gaseous products. Thus it is reasonable that entropy increases ( $\Delta S^{0}>0$ ).

The "mol" designation for $\Delta S_{\text {rxn }}^{0}$ refers to a mole of reaction, that is, one mole of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4}(\ell)$, two moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\ell)$, and so on. Although it may not appear to be, $+605.9 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ is a relatively large value of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}^{0}$. The positive entropy change favors spontaneity. This reaction is also exothermic ( $\Delta H^{0}$ is negative). As we shall see, this reaction must be spontaneous, because both factors are favorable: the reaction is exothermic ( $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is negative) and the disorder of the system increases ( $\Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is positive).

**You should now work Exercise 104.**

Because changes in the thermodynamic quantity entropy may be understood in terms of changes in energy dispersal and molecular disorder, we can often predict the sign of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. The following illustrations emphasize several common types of processes that result in predictable entropy changes for the system.

Phase changes. In a solid, the molecules are in an ordered arrangement, where they can vibrate only around their relatively fixed positions. In a liquid, the molecules are more disordered, so they exchange energy much more freely, and the entropy is higher than in the solid. Similarly, gas molecules are in a much larger volume, and they are far less restrained than in the liquid. In the gas, they move even more randomly, both in direction and in speed; this gives any substance a much higher entropy as a gas than as a liquid or a solid (Figure 15-16). Thus the processes of melting, vaporization, and sublimation are always accompanied by an increase in entropy (Figure 15-17). The reverse processes of freezing, condensation, and deposition always correspond to a decrease in entropy.

For any substance, entropy increases in the order solid $<$ liquid $<$ gas.
Melting, vaporization, and sublimation always have $S_{\text {system }}>0$.
Freezing, condensation, and deposition always have $S_{\text {system }}<0$.

Temperature changes. As the temperature of any sample increases, its molecules have increased total kinetic energy; this higher energy can be dispersed among these molecules in more ways, increasing the entropy of the sample. Furthermore, the greater motion of the molecules (translational for gases and liquids, vibrational for solids) corresponds to a state of greater matter dispersal. The increased dispersal of matter and energy leads to the following result.

The entropy of any sample increases as its temperature increases.

Figure 15-16 As a sample changes from solid to liquid to gas, its particles become increasingly more disordered, allowing greater dispersal of energy, so its entropy increases.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/eb1b0ed4-5994-4be8-8a1a-04e4127a367d-36.jpg?height=599&width=979&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=107)
Figure 15-17 The vaporization of bromine, $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \rightarrow \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ (left) and the sublimation of iodine, $\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ (right) both lead to an increase in disorder, so $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}>0$ for each process. Which do you think results in the more positive $\Delta S$ ? Carry out the calculation using values from Appendix K to check whether your prediction was correct.

Volume changes. When the volume of a sample of gas increases, the molecules can occupy more positions, and hence are more randomly arranged (greater dispersal of matter). As pointed out in Section 15-13, the energy levels available to the molecules are closer together in the larger volume, leading to more ways to distribute the same total energy (greater dispersal of energy). Thus a gas has higher entropy at higher volume.

The entropy of a gas increases as its volume increases.
For an increase in gas volume, $S_{\text {system }}>0$.

Mixing of substances, even without chemical reaction. Situations in which particles of more than one kind are "mixed up" are more disordered (greater dispersal of matter) and can exchange energy among both like and unlike particles (greater dispersal of energy). The entropy of the mixture is thus greater than that of the individual substances. This increase in entropy favors processes such as the mixing of gases (Figure 15-10) and the dissolving of solid and liquid solutes in liquid solvents (Figures 15-18 and 15-19; see also Section 14-2). For example, when one mole of solid NaCl dissolves in water, $\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq})$, the entropy (Appendix K) increases from $72.4 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ to $115.5 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, or $\Delta S^{0}= +43.1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. The term "mixing" can be interpreted rather liberally. For example, the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})$ has $\Delta S^{0}>0$; in the reactants, each atom is bonded to an identical atom, a less "mixed-up" situation than in the products, where unlike atoms are bonded together.

Mixing of substances or dissolving a solid in a liquid causes an increase in entropy, $S_{\text {system }}>0$.

Changes in the number of particles, as in the dissociation of a diatomic gas such as $\mathrm{F}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{~F}(\mathrm{~g})$. Any process in which the number of particles increases results in an increase in entropy, $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}>0$. Values of $\Delta S^{0}$ calculated for several reactions of this type are given in Table 15-5. As you can see, the $\Delta S^{0}$ values for the dissociation process $\mathrm{X}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{X}$ are all similar for $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{Cl}$, and N . Why is the value given in Table 15-5 so much larger for $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{Br}$ ? This process starts with liquid $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$. The total process

Figure 15-18 As particles leave a crystal to go into solution, they become more disordered and energy dispersal increases. This favors dissolution of the solid.

Table 15-5 Entropy Changes for Some Processes $X_{2} \longrightarrow 2 X$

| Reaction | $\Delta S^{0}$ $\left(\mathrm{J}\,\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}\right)$ |
| :--- | ---: |
| $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{H}(\mathrm{g})$ | 98.0 |
| $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{N}(\mathrm{g})$ | 114.9 |
| $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$ | 117.0 |
| $\mathrm{F}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{g})$ | 114.5 |
| $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{g}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{Cl}(\mathrm{g})$ | 107.2 |
| $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{g})$ | 197.6 |
| $\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{s}) \longrightarrow 2\,\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{g})$ | 245.3 |


Do you think that the reaction

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

would have a higher or lower value of $\Delta S^{0}$ than when the water is in the gas phase? Confirm by calculation.
$\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=197.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, can be treated as the result of two processes. The first of these is vaporization, $\operatorname{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow \operatorname{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=93.2 \mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. The second step is the dissociation of gaseous bromine, $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=104.4 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$; this entropy increase is about the same as for the other processes that involve only dissociation of a gaseous diatomic species. Can you rationalize the even higher value given in the table for the process $\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{g})$ ?

Increasing the number of particles causes an increase in entropy, $S_{\text {system }}>0$.

Changes in the number of moles of gaseous substances. Processes that result in an increase in the number of moles of gaseous substances have $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}>0$. Example 15-16 illustrates this. There are no gaseous reactants, but the products include five moles of gas. Conversely, we would predict that the process $2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$ has a negative $\Delta S^{0}$ value; here, three moles of gas is consumed while only two moles is produced, for a net decrease in the number of moles in the gas phase. You should be able to calculate the value of $\Delta S^{0}$ for this reaction from the values in Appendix K.

An increase in the number of moles of gaseous substances causes an increase in entropy, $S_{\text {system }}>0$.

The following guidelines for absolute entropy (standard molar entropy) for individual substances can also be helpful in predicting entropy changes.

Molecular size and complexity. For molecules with similar formulas, absolute entropies usually increase with increasing molecular weight. For instance, the entropies of the
gaseous hydrogen halide increase in the order $\mathrm{HF}(173.7 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})<\mathrm{HCl}(186.8 \mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})<\mathrm{HBr}(198.59 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})<\mathrm{HI}(206.5 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})$. In more complicated molecular structures, there are more ways for the atoms to move about in three-dimensional space, so there is greater entropy. This trend is especially strong for a series of related compounds. For instance, the absolute entropy of liquid hydrogen peroxide, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(109.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ), is greater than that of liquid water, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(69.91 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})$. Gaseous $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$ has a greater absolute entropy ( $353 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ) than gaseous $\mathrm{PCl}_{3}(311.7 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ).

Ionic compounds with similar formulas but different charges. Stronger ionic attractions (due to higher charges or closer approach) hold the ions more tightly in their crystal positions, so they vibrate less, leading to lower entropy. For instance, CaS and KCl have similar formula weights; but CaS ( $2+$ and $2-$ ionic charges ) has stronger ionic attractive forces than $\mathrm{KCl}(1+, 1-$ charges $)$, consistent with their relative entropies $\mathrm{CaS}(56.5 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})<\mathrm{KCl} (82.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})$.

**Plan**

We use the qualitative guidelines described above to predict whether entropy increases or decreases.

**Solution**

(a) In this reaction, $9 / 2$ moles $(4.5$ moles $)$ of gaseous reactants produce 5 moles of gaseous products. This increase in number of moles of gas leads to an increase in entropy, $\Delta S^{0}>0$.
(b) Here 3 moles of gaseous reactants produce only liquid product. This decrease in number of moles of gas leads to a decrease in entropy, $\Delta S^{0}<0$.
(c) In this reaction, there are 6 moles of gaseous reactants and the same number of moles of gaseous products, so the prediction cannot be made on this basis. One of the reactants, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}$, is a solid. The total entropy of one mole of solid and six moles of gas (reactants) is less than the total entropy of six moles of gas and six moles of liquid (products), so we predict an increase in entropy, $\Delta S^{0}>0$.

**You should now work Exercise 100.**

**Solution**

(a) For any substance, entropy increases in the order solid $<$ liquid $<$ gas, so we predict the absolute entropies to increase as $\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{s})<\mathrm{Hg}(\ell)<\mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{g})$.
(b) Entropy increases with molecular complexity, so we predict the absolute entropies to increase in the order $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})<\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}(\mathrm{~g})<\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}(\mathrm{~g})$.
(c) Both of these ionic compounds contain $2+$ and $2-$ ions, so charge differences alone will not allow us to rank them. But $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ions are smaller than $\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions, so they are held closer to the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, giving a stronger attraction in CaO and hence lower entropy. We expect the absolute entropies to increase in the order $\mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s})<\mathrm{CaS}(\mathrm{s})$.
