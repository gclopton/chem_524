# 15-5 Thermochemical Equations

A balanced chemical equation, written together with a description of the corresponding heat change, is called a thermochemical equation. For example,

$$
\underset{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)}+\underset{3 \mathrm{~mol}}{3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})} \longrightarrow \underset{2 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}+\underset{3 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)}+1367 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

is a thermochemical equation that describes the combustion (burning) of one mole of liquid ethanol at a particular temperature and pressure. The coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation must be interpreted as numbers of moles of each reactant and product. Thus, 1367 kJ of heat is released when one mole of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)$ reacts with three moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ to give two moles of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and three moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$. We refer to this amount of reaction as one mole of reaction, which we abbreviate "mol rxn." This interpretation allows us to write various unit factors as desired.

$$
\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}, \frac{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}, \frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { of heat released }}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \text {, and so on }
$$

The thermochemical equation is more commonly written as

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \quad \Delta H=-1367 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

The negative sign indicates that this is an exothermic reaction (i.e., it gives off heat).

When dilute aqueous solutions are mixed, their volumes are very nearly additive.

**Plan**

We scale the amount of heat given off in the experiment to correspond to the amount of $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}_{3}$ shown in the balanced equation.

4．The value of $\Delta H$ usually does not change significantly with moderate changes in temperature．
3．The physical states of all species are important and must be specified．Heat is given off or absorbed when phase changes occur，so different amounts of heat could be involved in a reaction depending on the phases of reactants and products．
The coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation refer to the numbers of moles of reactants and products involved．In the thermodynamic interpretation of equations， we never interpret the coefficients as numbers of molecules．Thus，it is acceptable to write coefficients as fractions rather than as integers，when convenient．But most chemists prefer to use the smallest integer values for the coefficients．

2．The numerical value of $\Delta H$（or any other thermodynamic change）is specific to the number of moles of substances specified by the balanced equation．This amount of change is called one mole of reaction，so we can express $\Delta H$ in units of energy $/ \mathrm{mol}$ rxn． For brevity，the units of $\Delta H$ are sometimes written $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ or even just kJ ．No matter what units are used，be sure that you interpret the thermodynamic change per mole of reaction for the balanced chemical equation to which it refers．If a different amount of material is involved in the reaction，then the $\Delta H$（or other change）must be scaled accordingly．
It is important to remember the following conventions regarding thermochemical equations：

1．The coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation refer to the numbers of moles The reverse reaction would require the absorption of 1367 kJ under the same conditions．

$$
1367 \mathrm{~kJ}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

That is，it is endothermic，with $\Delta H=+1367 \mathrm{~kJ}$ ．

$$
2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H=+1367 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

It is important to remember the following conventions regarding thermochemical
We can then use several unit factors to interpret this thermochemical equation．

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{\text { mol of reaction }} & =\frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell) \text { consumed }}=\frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{3 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \text { consumed }} \\
& =\frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \text { formed }}=\frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{3 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \text { formed }}
\end{aligned}
$$

can then use several unit factors to interpret this thermochemical equation．

We always interpret $\Delta H$ as the enthalpy change for the reaction as written；that is，as （enthalpy change）／（mole of reaction），where the denominator means＂for the number of moles of each substance shown by the coefficients in the balanced equation．＂

**Solution**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text { ? } \mathrm{kJ} \text { given off }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}} & =\frac{82.5 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{2.61 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}_{3}} \times \frac{46.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}_{3}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}_{3}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OCH}_{3}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \\
& =1450 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because heat is given off, we know that the reaction is exothermic so the value of $\Delta H$ should be negative.

$$
\Delta H=-1450 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 21.**


> [!example] Example 15-4: Thermochemical Equations
> 
> Write the thermochemical equation for the reaction in Example 15-2.

**Plan**

We must determine how much reaction occurred-that is, how many moles of reactants were consumed. We first multiply the volume, in liters, of each solution by its concentration in $\mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}$ (molarity) to determine the number of moles of each reactant mixed. Then we identify the limiting reactant. We scale the amount of heat released in the experiment to correspond to the number of moles of that reactant shown in the balanced equation.

**Solution**

Using the data from Example 15-2,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \underline{?} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}=0.0500 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{0.400 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}}{1.00 \mathrm{~L}}=0.0200 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4} \\
& \underline{?} \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}=0.0500 \mathrm{~L} \times \frac{0.600 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}{1.00 \mathrm{~L}}=0.0300 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Required Ratio**

$$
\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}}{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}=\frac{0.500 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}}{1.00 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}
$$

We determine which is the limiting reactant (review Section 3-3).

**Available Ratio**

$\frac{0.0200 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO}}{0.0300 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}=\frac{0.667 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CuSO} \mathrm{Cu}_{4}}{1.00 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}$

More $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}$ is available than is required to react with the NaOH . Thus, 0.846 kJ of heat was given off during the consumption of 0.0300 mol of NaOH . The amount of heat given off per "mole of reaction" is

$$
\xlongequal[\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}]{\stackrel{?}{\mathrm{~kJ}} \text { released }}=\frac{0.846 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{0.0300 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}} \times \frac{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaOH}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}=\frac{56.4 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { given off }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}}
$$

Thus, when the reaction occurs to the extent indicated by the balanced chemical equation, 56.4 kJ is released. Remembering that exothermic reactions have negative values of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}$, we write

$$
\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}=-56.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

You should now work Exercise 64(b).

> The sign tells us that heat was released, but it would be grammatical nonsense to say in words that " -751 kJ of heat was released." As an analogy, suppose you give your friend $\$ 5$. Your $\Delta$ is $-\$ 5$, but in describing the transaction you would not say "I gave her minus five dollars." Instead, you would say, "I gave her five dollars."

A temperature of $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $77^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. This is slightly above typical room temperature. Notice that these thermodynamic "standard conditions" are not the same as the "standard temperature and pressure (STP)" that we used in gas calculations involving standard molar volume (Chapter 12).

If the substance exists in several different forms, the form that is most stable at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 1 atm is the standard state.

For gas laws (Chapter 12), standard temperature is taken as $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For thermodynamics, it is taken as $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

**Plan**

The thermochemical equation tells us that 3352 kJ of heat is released for every mole of reaction, that is, for every 4 moles of Al that reacts. We convert 24.2 g of Al to moles and then calculate the number of kilojoules corresponding to that number of moles of Al , using the unit factors

$$
\frac{-3352 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \quad \text { and } \quad \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}{4 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Al}}
$$

**Solution**

For 24.2 g Al ,

$$
\text { ? } \mathrm{kJ}=24.2 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Al} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Al}}{27.0 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Al}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}{4 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Al}} \times \frac{-3352 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}=-751 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

This tells us that 751 kJ of heat is released to the surroundings during the oxidation of 24.2 grams of aluminum.

**You should now work Exercises 16 and 17.**

> Remember that a thermochemical equation can have different coefficients (numbers of moles) of different reactants or products, which need not equal one. In Example 15-5 one mole of reaction corresponds to 4 moles of $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{s}), 3$ moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$, and 2 moles of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$.
