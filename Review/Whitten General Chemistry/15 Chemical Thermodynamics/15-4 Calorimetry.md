# 15-4 Calorimetry

We can determine the energy change associated with a chemical or physical process by using an experimental technique called calorimetry. This technique is based on observing the temperature change when a system absorbs or releases energy in the form of heat. The experiment is carried out in a device called a calorimeter, in which the temperature change of a known amount of substance (often water) of known specific heat is measured. The temperature change is caused by the absorption or release of heat by the chemical or physical process under study. A review of calculations involved with heat transfer (Sections 1-14, 13-9, and 13-11) will help you understand this section.

A "coffee-cup" calorimeter (Figure 15-3) is often used in laboratory classes to measure "heats of reaction" at constant pressure, $q_{\mathrm{p}}$, in aqueous solutions. Reactions are chosen so that there are no gaseous reactants or products. Thus, all reactants and products remain in the vessel throughout the experiment. Such a calorimeter could be used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released when a reaction takes place in aqueous solution. We can consider the reactants and products as the system and the calorimeter plus the solution (mostly water) as the surroundings. For an exothermic reaction, the amount of heat evolved by the reaction can be calculated from the amount by which it causes the temperature of the calorimeter and the solution to rise. The heat can be visualized as divided into two parts.

> $$
> \binom{\text { amount of heat }}{\text { released by reaction }}=\binom{\text { amount of heat absorbed }}{\text { by calorimeter }}+\binom{\text { amount of heat }}{\text { absorbed by solution }}
> $$

The amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is sometimes expressed as the heat capacity of the calorimeter, in joules per degree. The heat capacity of a calorimeter is determined by adding a known amount of heat and measuring the rise in temperature of the calorimeter and of the solution it contains. This heat capacity of a calorimeter is sometimes called its calorimeter constant.

The symbol $q$ represents the amount of heat absorbed by the system. The subscript p indicates a constant-pressure process.

The polystyrene insulation of the simple coffee-cup calorimeter ensures that little heat escapes from or enters the container.

One way to add heat is to use an electric heater.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> Note that, because we are using the change in temperature ( $\Delta T$ ) in this example, temperatures can be expressed as ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or K . That is because the magnitude of $a$ change of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is equal to 1 K . In this problem $\Delta T=14.40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=$ 14.40 K . But, when working with mathematical equations that use absolute temperatures $T$ (not $\Delta T!)$, it is important to express temperatures in kelvins. In this chapter, we will see mathematical formulas that use $T$ and $\Delta T$, so it is important to keep track of which is being used.

> Figure 15-3 A coffee-cup calorimeter. The stirring rod is moved up and down to ensure thorough mixing and uniform heating of the solution during reaction. The polystyrene walls and top provide insulation so that very little heat escapes. This kind of calorimeter measures $q_{p}$, the heat transfer due to a reaction occurring at constant pressure.

> [!example] Example 15-1: Heat Capacity of a Calorimeter
> 
> We add 3.358 kJ of heat to a calorimeter that contains 50.00 g of water. The temperature of the water and the calorimeter, originally at $22.34^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, increases to $36.74^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Calculate the heat capacity of the calorimeter in $\mathrm{J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The specific heat of water is $4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

**Plan**

We first calculate the amount of heat gained by the water in the calorimeter. The rest of the heat must have been gained by the calorimeter, so we can determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter.

**Solution**

$$
50.00 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \text { at } 22.34^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \longrightarrow 50.00 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \text { at } 36.74^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The temperature change is $(36.74-22.34)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=14.40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

$$
\text { ? } \mathrm{J}=50.00 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{4.184 \mathrm{~J}}{\mathrm{~g} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \times 14.40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=3.012 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}
$$

The total amount of heat added was 3.358 kJ or $3.358 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}$. The difference between these heat values is the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter.
? $\mathrm{J}=3.358 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}-3.012 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=0.346 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}$, or 346 J absorbed by the calorimeter
To obtain the heat capacity of the calorimeter, we divide the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter, 346 J , by its temperature change.

$$
? \frac{\mathrm{~J}}{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=\frac{346 \mathrm{~J}}{14.40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=24.0 \mathrm{~J} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
$$

The calorimeter absorbs 24.0 J of heat for each degree Celsius increase in its temperature.

**You should now work Exercise 60.**


> [!example] Example 15-2: Heat Measurements Using a Calorimeter
> 
> A $50.0-\mathrm{mL}$ sample of $0.400 M$ copper(II) sulfate solution at $23.35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.600 M sodium hydroxide solution, also at $23.35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, in the coffee-cup calorimeter of Example 15-1. After the reaction occurs, the temperature of the resulting mixture is measured to be $25.23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The density of the final solution is $1.02 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$. Calculate the amount of heat evolved. Assume that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that of pure water, $4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
> 
> $$
> \mathrm{CuSO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})
> $$

**Plan**

The amount of heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the calorimeter and by the solution. To find the amount of heat absorbed by the solution, we must know the mass of solution; to find that, we assume that the volume of the reaction mixture is the sum of the volumes of the original solutions.

**Solution**

The mass of solution is

$$
\underline{\mathrm{g}} \text { soln }=(50.0+50.0) \mathrm{mL} \times \frac{1.02 \mathrm{~g} \text { soln }}{\mathrm{mL}}=102 \mathrm{~g} \text { soln }
$$

The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter plus the amount absorbed by the solution is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\underline{\underline{?}} \mathrm{~J} & =\overbrace{\frac{24.0 \mathrm{~J}}{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \times(25.23-23.35)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}^{\begin{array}{c}
\text { amount of heat } \\
\text { absorbed by calorimeter }
\end{array}}+\overbrace{102 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{4.18 \mathrm{~J}}{\mathrm{~g} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \times(25.23-23.35)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}^{\begin{array}{c}
\text { amount of heat } \\
\text { absorbed by calorimeter }
\end{array}} \\
& =45 \mathrm{~J}+801 \mathrm{~J}=846 \mathrm{~J} \text { absorbed by solution plus calorimeter }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the reaction must have liberated 846 J , or 0.846 kJ , of heat.

**You should now work Exercise 64(a).**
