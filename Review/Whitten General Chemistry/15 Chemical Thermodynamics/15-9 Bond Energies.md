# 15-9 Bond Energies

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds. Energy is always required to break a chemical bond (Section 7-4). Often this energy is supplied in the form of heat.

The bond energy (B.E.) is the amount of energy necessary to break one mole of bonds in a gaseous covalent substance to form products in the gaseous state at constant temperature and pressure.

The greater the bond energy, the more stable (stronger) the bond is, and the harder it is to break. Thus bond energy is a measure of bond strengths.

Consider the following reaction.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\Delta H_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}}=+436 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H} \text { bonds }
$$

The bond energy of the hydrogen-hydrogen bond is $436 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of bonds. In other words, 436 kJ of energy must be absorbed for every mole of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds that are broken. This endothermic reaction ( $\Delta H_{\text {rxn }}^{0}$ is positive) can be written

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+436 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

For all practical purposes, the bond energy is the same as bond enthalpy. Tabulated values of average bond energies are actually average bond enthalpies. We use the term "bond energy" rather than "bond enthalpy" because it is common practice to do so.

We have discussed these changes in terms of absorption or release of heat. Another way of breaking bonds is by absorption of light energy (Chapter 4). Bond energies can be determined from the energies of the photons that cause bond dissociation.

Some average bond energies are listed in Tables 15-2 and 15-3. We see from Table 15-3 that for any combination of elements, a triple bond is stronger than a double bond, which in turn is stronger than a single bond. Bond energies for double and triple bonds are not simply two or three times those for the corresponding single bonds. A single bond is a $\sigma$ bond, whereas double and triple bonds involve a combination of $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonding. The bond energy measures the difficulty of overcoming the orbital overlap, and we should not expect the strength of a $\pi$ bond to be the same as that of a $\sigma$ bond between the same two atoms.

We should keep in mind that each of the values listed is the average bond energy from a variety of compounds. The average $C-H$ bond energy is $413 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of bonds. Average $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond energies differ slightly from compound to compound, as in $\mathrm{CH}_{4}, \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}$, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NO}_{2}$, and so on. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently constant to be useful in estimating thermodynamic data that are not readily available by another approach. Values of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ estimated in this way are not as reliable as those obtained from $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ values for the substances involved in the reaction.

A special case of Hess's Law involves the use of bond energies to estimate heats of reaction. Consider the enthalpy diagrams in Figure 15-5. In general terms, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is related to the bond energies of the reactants and products in gas phase reactions by the following version of Hess's Law.

The net enthalpy change of a reaction is the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in reactant molecules minus the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in product molecules. Stated in another way, the amount of energy released when a

As usual for such diagrams, the value shown for each change refers to the number of moles of substances or bonds indicated in the diagram.
bond is formed is equal to the amount absorbed when the same bond is broken. The heat of reaction for a gas phase reaction can be described as the amount of energy released in forming all the bonds in the products minus the amount of energy released in forming all the bonds in the reactants (Figure 15-5). This heat of reaction can be estimated using the average bond energies in Tables 15-2 and 15-3.

The definition of bond energies is limited to the bond-breaking process only, and does not include any provision for changes of state. Thus, it is valid only for substances in the gaseous state. The calculations of this section therefore apply only when all substances in the reaction are gases. If liquids or solids were involved, then additional information such as heats of vaporization and fusion would be needed to account for phase changes.

> $$

**Plan**

Each $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ molecule contains three N - H bonds, so two moles of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ contain six moles of $\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds. Three moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ contain a total of three moles of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds, and one mole of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ contains one mole of $\mathrm{N} \equiv \mathrm{N}$ bonds. From this we can estimate the heat of reaction.

**Solution**

Using the bond energy form of Hess's Law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =\left[\Delta H_{\mathrm{N} \equiv \mathrm{~N}}+3 \Delta H_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}}\right]-\left[6 \Delta H_{\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H}}\right] \\
& =945+3(436)-6(361)=-93 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 48.**


For each term in the sum, the units are

$$
\frac{\text { mol bonds }}{\text { mol rxn }} \times \frac{\mathrm{kJ}}{\mathrm{~mol} \text { bonds }}
$$

> We would get the same value for $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ if we used the full bond energy form of Hess's Law and assumed that all bonds in reactants were broken and then all bonds in products were formed. In such a calculation the bond energies for the unchanged bonds would cancel. Why? Try it!

Internal energy is a state function, so it is represented by a capital letter.

Use the bond energies listed in Table 15-2 to estimate the heat of reaction at 298 K for the following reaction.

**Plan**

Two moles of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds and seven moles of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds are the same before and after reaction, so we do not need to include them in the bond energy calculation. The only reactant bonds that are broken are one mole of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds and one mole of $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bonds. On the product side, the only new bonds formed are one mole of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bonds and one mole of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bonds. We need to take into account only the bonds that are different on the two sides of the equation. As before, we add and subtract the appropriate bond energies, using values from Table 15-2.

**Solution**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =\left[\Delta H_{\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}}+\Delta H_{\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{Cl}}\right]-\left[\Delta H_{\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}}+\Delta H_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{Cl}}\right] \\
& =[413+242]-[339+432]=-116 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
\end{aligned}
$$
