# 15-10 Changes in Internal Energy, $\Delta E$

The internal energy, $\boldsymbol{E}$, of a specific amount of a substance represents all the energy contained within the substance. It includes such forms as kinetic energies of the molecules; energies of attraction and repulsion among subatomic particles, atoms, ions, or molecules; and other forms of energy. The internal energy of a collection of molecules is a state function. The difference between the internal energy of the products and the internal energy of the reactants of a chemical reaction or physical change, $\Delta E$, is given by the equation

> [!equation] First law (internal energy balance)
> $$
> \Delta E=E_{\text {final }}-E_{\text {initial }}=E_{\text {products }}-E_{\text {reactants }}=q+w
> $$

The terms $q$ and $w$ represent heat and work, respectively. These are two ways in which energy can flow into or out of a system. Work involves a change of energy in which a body is moved through a distance, $d$, against some force, $f$; that is, $w=f d$.

$$
\Delta E=\text { (amount of heat absorbed by system) }+ \text { (amount of work done on system) }
$$

Whenever a given amount of energy is added to or removed from a system, either as heat or as work, the energy of the system changes by that same amount. The equation $\Delta E=q+w$ is another way of expressing the First Law of Thermodynamics (Section 15-1).

The only type of work involved in most chemical and physical changes is pressurevolume work. From dimensional analysis we can see that the product of pressure and volume is work. Pressure is the force exerted per unit area, where area is distance squared, $d^{2}$; volume is distance cubed, $d^{3}$. Thus, the product of pressure and volume is force times distance, which is work. An example of a physical change (a phase change) in which the system expands and thus does work as it absorbs heat is shown in Figure 15-6. Even if the book had not been present, the expanding system pushing against the atmosphere would have done work for the expansion.

When energy is released by a reacting system, $\Delta E$ is negative; energy can be written as a product in the equation for the reaction. When the system absorbs energy from the surroundings, $\Delta E$ is positive; energy can be written as a reactant in the equation.

For example, the complete combustion of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ at constant volume at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ releases energy.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\underset{\text { indicates release of energy }}{2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+887 \mathrm{~kJ}}
$$

We can write the change in energy that accompanies this reaction as

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \quad \Delta E=-887 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

As discussed in Section 15-2, the negative sign indicates a decrease in energy of the system, or a release of energy by the system.

The reverse of this reaction absorbs energy. It can be written as
or

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+887 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

indicates absorption of energy

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta E=+887 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

If the latter reaction could be forced to occur, the system would have to absorb 887 kJ of energy per mole of reaction from its surroundings.

When a gas is produced against constant external pressure, such as in an open vessel at atmospheric pressure, the gas does work as it expands against the pressure of the atmosphere. If no heat is absorbed during the expansion, the result is a decrease in the internal

(b) As the dry ice absorbs heat from the surroundings, some solid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sublimes to form gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The larger volume of the gas causes the bag to expand. The expanding gas does the work of raising a book that has been placed on the bag. Work would be done by the expansion, even if the book were not present, as the bag pushes against the surrounding atmosphere. The heat absorbed by such a process at constant pressure, $q_{p}$, is equal to $\Delta H$ for the process.

> $V_{2}$ is the final volume, and $V_{1}$ is the initial volume.
Let us illustrate the latter case. Consider the complete reaction of a 2:1 mole ratio of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to produce steam at some constant temperature above $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at one atmosphere pressure (Figure 15-7).

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g})+\text { heat }
$$

Assume that the constant-temperature bath surrounding the reaction vessel completely absorbs all the evolved heat so that the temperature of the gases does not change. The volume of the system decreases by one third ( 3 mol gaseous reactants $\rightarrow 2 \mathrm{~mol}$ gaseous products). The surroundings exert a constant pressure of one atmosphere and do work on the system by compressing it. The internal energy of the system increases by an amount equal to the amount of work done on it.

The work done on or by a system depends on the external pressure and the volume. When the external pressure is constant during a change, the amount of work done is equal to this pressure times the change in volume. The work done on a system equals $-P \Delta V$ or $-P\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$.

| Compression (volume decreases) | Expansion (volume increases) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Work is done $b y$ the surroundings on the system, so the sign of $w$ is positive | Work is done by the system on the surroundings, so the sign of $w$ is negative |
| $V_{2}$ is less than $V_{1}$, so $\Delta V=\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$ is negative | $V_{2}$ is greater than $V_{1}$, so $\Delta V=\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$ is positive |
| Can be due to a decrease in number of moles of gas ( $\Delta n$ negative) | Can be due to an increase in number of moles of gas ( $\Delta n$ positive) |

We substitute $-P \Delta V$ for $w$ in the equation $\Delta E=q+w$ to obtain

> [!equation] Internal energy change with pressure–volume work
> $$
> \Delta E=q-P \Delta V
> $$

In constant-volume reactions, no $P \Delta V$ work is done. Volume does not change, so nothing "moves through a distance," and $d=0$ and $f d=0$. The change in internal energy of the system is just the amount of heat absorbed or released at constant volume, $q_{\mathrm{v}}$.

> [!equation] Internal energy change at constant volume
> $$
> \Delta E=q_{\mathrm{v}}
> $$

Figure 15-8 shows the same phase change process as in Figure 15-6, but at constant volume condition, so no work is done.

Solids and liquids do not expand or contract significantly when the pressure changes $(\Delta V \approx 0)$. In reactions in which equal numbers of moles of gases are produced and consumed at constant temperature and pressure, essentially no work is done. By the ideal gas equation, $P \Delta V=(\Delta n) R T$ and $\Delta n=0$, where $\Delta n$ equals the number of moles of gaseous products minus the number of moles of gaseous reactants. Thus, the work term $w$ has a significant value at constant pressure only when there are different numbers of moles of gaseous products and reactants so that the volume of the system changes.

**Plan**

For a process at constant pressure, $w=-P \Delta V=-(\Delta n) R T$. For each reaction, we evaluate $\Delta n$, the change in the number of moles of gaseous substances in the reaction.

$$
\Delta n=\text { (no. of moles of gaseous products) }- \text { (no. of moles of gaseous reactants) }
$$

Because both $R$ and $T$ (on the Kelvin scale) are positive quantities, the sign of $w$ is opposite from that of $\Delta n$; it tells us whether the work is done $o n(w=+)$ or $b y(w=-)$ the system.

The decomposition of $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}$ produces large amounts of gas, which expands rapidly as the very fast reaction occurs. This explosive reaction was the main cause of the destruction of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995.

Do not make the error of setting work equal to $V \Delta P$.

A subscript v indicates a constantvolume process; a subscript p indicates a constant-pressure process.

Active Figure 15-8 A system that absorbs heat at constant volume. Some dry ice $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})\right]$ is placed into a rigid flask, which is then sealed. As the dry ice absorbs heat from the surroundings, some $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (s) sublimes to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$. In contrast to the case in Figure 15-6, this system cannot expand ( $\Delta V=0$ ), so no work is done, and the pressure in the flask increases. Thus, the heat absorbed at constant volume, $q_{\mathrm{v}}$, is equal to $\Delta E$ for the process.

$\Delta n$ refers to the balanced equation.

Here there are no gaseous reactants.

The "calorie content" of a food can be determined by burning it in excess oxygen inside a bomb calorimeter and determining the heat released. 1 "nutritional Calorie" = $1 \mathrm{kcal}=$ 4.184 kJ .

Benzoic acid, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{COOH}$, is often used to determine the heat capacity of a calorimeter. It is a solid that can be compressed into pellets. Its heat of combustion is accurately known: $3227 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ benzoic acid, or $26.46 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{g}$ benzoic acid. Another way to measure the heat capacity of a calorimeter is to add a known amount of heat electrically.

**Solution**

(a) $\Delta n=\left[2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+4 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})+1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})\right]-0 \mathrm{~mol}$

$$
=7 \mathrm{~mol}-0 \mathrm{~mol}=+7 \mathrm{~mol}
$$

$\Delta n$ is positive, so $w$ is negative. This tells us that work is done $b y$ the system. The large amount of gas formed by the reaction pushes against the surroundings (as happened with devastating effect in the Texas City disaster).
(b) $\Delta n=[2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})]-\left[1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})\right]$

$$
=2 \mathrm{~mol}-2 \mathrm{~mol}=0 \mathrm{~mol}
$$

Thus, $w=0$, and no work is done as the reaction proceeds. We can see from the balanced equation that for every two moles (total) of gas that react, two moles of gas are formed, so the volume neither expands nor contracts as the reaction occurs.
(c) $\Delta n=\left[2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})\right]-\left[2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})\right]$

$$
=2 \mathrm{~mol}-3 \mathrm{~mol}=-1 \mathrm{~mol}
$$

$\Delta n$ is negative, so $w$ is positive. This tells us that work is done on the system as the reaction proceeds. The surroundings push against the diminishing volume of gas.

**You should now work Exercises 77 and 78.**

A bomb calorimeter is a device that measures the amount of heat evolved or absorbed by a reaction occurring at constant volume (Figure 15-9). A strong steel vessel (the bomb) is immersed in a large volume of water. As heat is produced or absorbed by a reaction inside the steel vessel, the heat is transferred to or from the large volume of water. Thus, only rather small temperature changes occur. For all practical purposes, the energy changes associated with the reactions are measured at constant volume and constant temperature. No work is done when a reaction is carried out in a bomb calorimeter, even if gases are involved, because $\Delta V=0$. Therefore,

$$
\Delta E=q_{\mathrm{v}} \quad \text { (constant volume) }
$$


> [!example] Example 15-14: Bomb Calorimeter
> 
> A 1.000-gram sample of ethanol, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$, was burned in a bomb calorimeter whose heat capacity had been determined to be $2.71 \mathrm{~kJ} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The temperature of 3000 grams of water rose from $24.284^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $26.225^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine $\Delta E$ for the reaction in joules per gram of ethanol, and then in kilojoules per mole of ethanol. The specific heat of water is $4.184 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{g} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The combustion reaction is
> 
> $$
> \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
> $$

**Plan**

The amount of heat given off by the system (in the sealed compartment) raises the temperature of the calorimeter and its water. The amount of heat absorbed by the water can be calculated using the specific heat of water; similarly, we use the heat capacity of the calorimeter to find the amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter. The sum of these two amounts of heat is the total amount of heat released by the combustion of 1.000 gram of ethanol. We must then scale that result to correspond to one mole of ethanol.

**Solution**

The increase in temperature is

$$
?{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=26.225^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-24.284^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=1.941^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \text { rise }
$$

The amount of heat responsible for this increase in temperature of 3000 grams of water is

$$
\text { heat to warm water }=1.941^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{4.184 \mathrm{~J}}{\sim} \times 3000 \mathrm{~g}=2.436 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}=24.36 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The amount of heat responsible for the warming of the calorimeter is

$$
\text { heat to warm calorimeter }=1.941^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \times \frac{2.71 \mathrm{~kJ}}{{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=5.26 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

The total amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter and by the water is

$$
\text { total amount of heat }=24.36 \mathrm{~kJ}+5.26 \mathrm{~kJ}=29.62 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Combustion of one gram of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ liberates 29.62 kJ of energy in the form of heat, that is

$$
\Delta E=q_{\mathrm{v}}=-29.62 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{g} \text { ethanol }
$$

The negative sign indicates that energy is released by the system to the surroundings. Now we may evaluate $\Delta E$ in $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of ethanol by converting grams of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ to moles.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{? \mathrm{~kJ}}{\text { mol ethanol }} & =\frac{-29.62 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{~g}} \times \frac{46.07 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{OH}}=-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { ethanol } \\
\Delta E & =-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { ethanol }
\end{aligned}
$$

This calculation shows that for the combustion of ethanol at constant temperature and constant volume, the change in internal energy is $-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ ethanol.
