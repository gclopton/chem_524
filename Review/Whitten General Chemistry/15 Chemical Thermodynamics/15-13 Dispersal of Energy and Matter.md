# 15-13 Dispersal of Energy and Matter

## Dispersal of Energy

The dispersal of energy in a system results in the energy being spread over many particles rather than being concentrated in just a few.

To understand this concept, think about a system consisting of just two molecules, A and B , with a total of two units of energy. Denoting one unit of energy with an*, we can list the three ways to distribute these two energy units over the two molecules as

A** (Molecule A has two units of energy, B has none.)
A*B* (Each molecule has one unit of energy.)
B** (Molecule B has two units of energy, A has none.)
Suppose these two molecules are mixed with two other molecules, C and D, that initially have no energy. When collisions occur, energy can be transferred from one molecule to another. Now the energy can be dispersed among the four molecules in ten different ways:

$$
\mathrm{A}^{* *} \mathrm{~B}^{* *} \mathrm{C}^{* *} \mathrm{D}^{* *} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*}
$$

Now there are obviously more ways (ten) the energy can be dispersed than before. In only three of these ways would all of the energy be distributed as before-A**, $\mathrm{A}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*}$, and $\mathrm{B}^{* *}$. Put another way, there is only a $3 / 10$ probability that the energy will be restricted to the original molecules, A and B. There are seven ways out of ten, or a probability of 7/10, that at least some of the energy has been transferred to C or D.

What would happen if large numbers of molecules were present, as in any real sample? The probability that the energy is dispersed would be huge, and there would be only an infinitesimally small chance that all of the energy would be concentrated in one or a few molecules. This reasoning leads us to an important conclusion.

If energy can be dispersed over a larger number of particles, it will be.

To see what happens if there is more energy to distribute (as at a higher temperature), let's consider another system with four molecules, but with two of the molecules (A and B) initially having three units of energy and the other two (C and D) initially with no energy, as shown in Figure 15-11a. When these molecules are brought together and allowed to exchange energy by colliding, the energy can be distributed in a total of 84 different ways,

> Figure 15-11 Possible ways of distributing six quanta of energy among four molecules. (a) Initially four molecules are separated from each other. Two molecules each have three quanta of energy, and the other two have none. A total of six quanta of energy will be distributed once the molecules interact. (b) Once the molecules begin to interact, there are nine ways to distribute the six available quanta. Each of these arrangements will have multiple ways of distributing the energy among the four molecules.

as shown in Figure 15-11b. For example, one molecule can have all six units of energy and the other three have no energy, as shown in the leftmost drawing of Figure 15-11b; the six-unit molecule could be any one of the four, so there are four ways to achieve this arrangement. Thus, the probability is only $4 / 84$ (or $1 / 21$ ) that all of the energy of the system is concentrated in one molecule. There are six ways to distribute the energy to arrive at the rightmost drawing (Figure 15-11c). Some of the other energy distributions can be achieved in many more ways, leading to a much higher probability for their occurrence. This leads to a broader statement of our earlier conclusion.

The greater the number of molecules and the higher the total energy of the system, the less likely the energy will be concentrated in a few molecules. Therefore, the energy will be more dispersed.

This generalization provides the molecular explanation behind the Maxwellian distribution of molecular speeds (kinetic energies) that was discussed in Section 12-13 (Active Figure 12-9) and in relation to evaporation and vapor pressures of liquids in Sections 13-6 and 13-7.

## Dispersal of Matter

Let us apply the idea of dispersal to the arrangements of matter and its molecules. Our experience tells us that a gas originally confined in a bulb (Figure 15-12a) will expand freely into a vacuum (Figure 15-12b). We don't expect the gas then to condense spontaneously into only one bulb. We can consider this expansion from the molecular point of view.

Suppose there are four molecules of gas in the two-part container of Figure 15-13. The probability that a particular molecule is on the left at any given time is $\frac{1}{2}$. A second specific molecule has its own probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ of being on the left, so the probability that both of these are on the left at the same time is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$. There are 16 ways that the molecules can be arranged in this container. But in only one of these arrangements are all four molecules in the left-hand portion of the container. The probability of that "condensed" arrangement is

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{4}=\frac{1}{16}
$$

We see that there is only a small likelihood that this gas would spontaneously condense to the left side of the container.

> Figure 15-12 The expansion of a gas into a vacuum. (a) The stopcock is closed, keeping all of the gas in the left bulb; the right bulb is empty (a vacuum). (b) When the stopcock is opened, the gas expands to fill the entire available volume, with half of the gas in each bulb.

Similar reasoning shows that the probability of one mole, or $6.0 \times 10^{23}$ molecules, spontaneously condensing into the left-hand bulb of Figure 15-12 would be

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \ldots \times \frac{1}{2}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6.0 \times 10^{23}}=\frac{1}{2^{6.0 \times 10^{23}}}
$$

Without writing the number in the denominator explicitly, we can mention that it is larger than the number of molecules in the entire universe! Thus there is virtually no chance that all $6.0 \times 10^{23}$ molecules in a mole of gas would spontaneously condense to half the available volume, leaving no molecules in the other half.

The dispersal of matter, as in the expansion of a gas, also often contributes to energy dispersal. Consider the expansion of a gas into a vacuum, as shown in Figure 15-14. When the gas is allowed to occupy the larger volume in Figure 15-14b, its energy levels become closer together than in the smaller volume of Figure 15-14a. This means that there are even more ways for the expanded gas to disperse its energy to arrive at the same total energy. The concept of dispersal of energy thus also predicts that the gas is far more likely to exist in the expanded state of Figure 15-14b, and we would not expect it to condense spontaneously to occupy only one chamber as in Figure 15-14a. Similar reasoning helps us to describe the spontaneous mixing of two gases in Figure 15-10. Each gas can have its energy more dispersed in its own more closely spaced energy levels when expanded into both containers. But in addition, the molecules of one gas can transfer energy to the molecules of the other gas by collision. This results in an even larger number of ways for the total energy of the mixture to be dispersed, leading to a much higher probability that the gases will be mixed (Figure 15-10a) than unmixed (Figure 15-10b). Thus the spatial dispersal of matter also results in a greater dispersal of energy.

When a soluble substance dissolves in a liquid, the solute particles become dispersed in the solvent (Sections 14-1 through 14-4). This allows the particles to transfer energy to one another, giving a larger number of ways of distributing the same total energy than if the substances remained in separate phases. In this case, too, dispersal of the two kinds of matter in one another allows more dispersal of energy. In more general terms, we often describe the dispersal of matter as an increase in disorder.

To summarize the conclusions of this section:
The final state of a system can be more probable than its initial state (spontaneous, product-favored) in either or both of two ways:

1. Energy can be dispersed over a greater number and variety of molecules.
2. The particles of the system can be more dispersed (more disordered).

Enthalpies are measured only as differences with respect to an arbitrary standard state. Entropies, in contrast, are defined relative to an absolute zero level. In either case, the per mole designation means per mole of substance in the specified state.

The $\Sigma n$ means that each $S^{0}$ value must be multiplied by the appropriate coefficient, $n$, from the balanced equation. These values are then added.
