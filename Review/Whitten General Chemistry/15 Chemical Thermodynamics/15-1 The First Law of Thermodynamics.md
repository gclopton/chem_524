# 15-1 The First Law of Thermodynamics

We can define energy as follows.

> [!Definition] Energy
> Energy is the capacity to do work or to transfer heat.

We classify energy into two general types: kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The kinetic energy of an object is equal to one half its mass, $m$, times the square of its velocity, $v$.

$$
E_{\text {kinetic }}=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

The heavier a hammer is and the more rapidly it moves, the greater its kinetic energy and the more work it can accomplish.

Potential energy is the energy that a system possesses by virtue of its position or composition. The work that we do to lift an object is stored in the object as energy; we describe this as potential energy. If we drop a hammer, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls, and it could do work on something it hits-for example, drive a nail or break a piece of glass. Similarly, an electron in an atom has potential energy because of the electrostatic force on it that is due to the positively charged nucleus and the other electrons in that atom and surrounding atoms. Energy can take many other forms: electrical energy, radiant energy (light), nuclear energy, and chemical energy. At the atomic or molecular level, we can think of each of these as either kinetic or potential energy.

The chemical energy in a fuel or food comes from potential energy stored in atoms due to their arrangements in the molecules. This stored chemical energy can be released when compounds undergo chemical changes, such as those that occur in combustion and metabolism.

Reactions that release energy in the form of heat are called exothermic reactions. Combustion reactions of fossil fuels are familiar examples of exothermic reactions. Hydrocarbons-including methane, the main component of natural gas, and octane, a minor component of gasoline-undergo combustion with an excess of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to yield $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. These reactions release heat energy. The amounts of heat energy released at constant pressure are shown for the reactions of one mole of methane and of two moles of octane.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+890 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
2 \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}(\ell)+25 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \longrightarrow 16 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+18 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+1.090 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

In such reactions, the total energy of the products is lower than that of the reactants by the amount of energy released, most of which is heat. Some initial activation (e.g., by heat) is needed to get these reactions started. This is shown for $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ in Figure 15-1. This activation energy plus 890 kJ is released as one mole of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$ are formed.

A process that absorbs energy from its surroundings is called endothermic. One such process is shown in Figure 15-2.

Energy changes accompany physical changes, too (Chapter 13). For example, the melting of one mole of ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at constant pressure must be accompanied by the absorption of 6.02 kJ of energy.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s})+6.02 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

This tells us that the total energy of the water is raised by 6.02 kJ in the form of heat during the phase change, even though the temperature remains constant.

> Figure 15-1 The difference between the potential energy of the reactants-one mole of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$-and that of the products-one mole of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$-is the amount of heat evolved in this exothermic reaction at constant pressure. For this reaction, it is $890 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of reaction. In this chapter, we see how to measure the heat absorbed or released and how to calculate it from other known heat changes. Some initial activation, by heat, for example, is needed to get the reaction started (Section 16-6). In the absence of such activation energy, a mixture of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be kept at room temperature for a long time without reacting. For an endothermic reaction, the final level is higher than the initial level.

> Active Figure 15-2 An endothermic process. (a) When solid hydrated barium hydroxide, $\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot 8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and excess solid ammonium nitrate, $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}$, are mixed, an endothermic reaction occurs.

$$
\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_{2} \cdot 8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ba}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})+10 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

The excess ammonium nitrate dissolves in the water produced in the reaction. (b) The dissolution process is also very endothermic. If the flask is placed on a wet wooden block, the water freezes and attaches the block to the flask.

Some important ideas about energy are summarized in the First Law of Thermodynamics.
The combined amount of matter and energy in the universe is constant.

The Law of Conservation of Energy is just another statement of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions and physical changes.

State functions are represented by capital letters. Here $P$ refers to pressure, $V$ to volume, and $T$ to absolute temperature.

> Here is a graphical representation of a $\$ 150$ decrease in your bank balance. We express the change in your bank balance as $\Delta \$=\$_{\text {final }}-\$_{\text {initial }}$. Your final balance is less than your initial balance, so the result is negative, indicating a decrease. There are many ways to get this same net changeone large withdrawal or some combination of deposits, withdrawals, interest earned, and service charges. All of the $\Delta$ values we will see in this chapter can be thought of in this way.
