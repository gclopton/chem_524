# 15-16 Free Energy Change, $\Delta G$, and Spontaneity

Energy is the capacity to do work. If heat is released in a chemical reaction ( $\Delta H$ is negative), some of the heat energy may be converted into useful work. If $\Delta S$ is negative, some of the energy must be expended to increase the order of the system. If the system becomes more disordered ( $\Delta S>0$ ), however, more useful energy becomes available than indicated by $\Delta H$ alone. J. Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), a prominent 19th-century American professor of mathematics and physics, formulated the relationship between enthalpy and entropy in terms of another state function that we now call the Gibbs free energy, $\boldsymbol{G}$. It is defined as

> [!equation] Gibbs free energy (definition)
> $$
> G=H-T S
> $$

The Gibbs free energy change, $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{G}$, at constant temperature and pressure, is

This is often called simply the Gibbs energy change or the free energy change.

> [!equation] Gibbs free energy change (constant $T$, $P$)
> $$
> \Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
> $$

The amount by which the Gibbs free energy decreases is the maximum useful energy obtainable in the form of work from a given process at constant temperature and pressure. It is also the indicator of spontaneity of a reaction or physical change at constant $T$ and $P$. If there is a net decrease of useful energy, $\Delta G$ is negative and the process is spontaneous (product-favored). We see from the equation that $\Delta G$ becomes more negative as (1) $\Delta H$ becomes more negative (the process gives off more heat) and (2) $\Delta S$ becomes more positive (the process results in greater disorder); both factors are favorable so the process must be spontaneous.

> (a) The entropy of an organism decreases (unfavorable) when new cells are formed. The energy to sustain animal life is provided by the metabolism of food. This energy is released when the chemical bonds in the food are broken. Exhalation of gases and excretion of waste materials increase the entropy of the surroundings enough so that the entropy of the universe increases and the overall process can occur. (b) Stored chemical energy can later be transformed by the organism to the mechanical energy for muscle contraction, to the electrical energy for brain function, or to another needed form.

If there is a net increase in free energy of the system during a process, $\Delta G$ is positive and the process is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored). This means that the reverse process is spontaneous under the given conditions. When $\Delta G=0$, there is no net transfer of free energy; both the forward and reverse processes are equally favorable. Thus, $\Delta G=0$ describes a system at equilibrium.

The relationship between $\Delta G$ and spontaneity may be summarized as follows.

| $\Delta G$ | Spontaneity of Reaction (constant $T$ and $P$ ) |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |
| $\Delta G$ is positive |  | Reaction is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored) |
| $\Delta G$ is zero |  | System is at equilibrium |
| $\Delta G$ is negative |  | Reaction is spontaneous (product-favored) |
| - | 0 + |  |
| $\Delta G<0$ |  | $\Delta G>0$ |
| Reaction is spontaneous |  | Reaction is not spontaneous |
| Product-favored reaction |  | Reactant-favored reaction |
| Forward reaction is favored |  | Reverse reaction is favored |

The free energy content of a system depends on temperature and pressure (and, for mixtures, on concentrations). The value of $\Delta G$ for a process depends on the states and the concentrations of the various substances involved. It also depends strongly on temperature, because the equation $\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S$ includes temperature. Just as for other thermodynamic variables, we choose some set of conditions as a standard state reference. The standard state for $\Delta G^{0}$ is the same as for $\Delta H^{0} ; 1 \mathrm{~atm}$ and the specified temperature, usually $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$. Values of standard molar free energy of formation, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$, for many substances are tabulated in Appendix K. For elements in their standard states, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}=0$. The values of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ may be used to calculate the standard free energy change of a reaction at 298 $K$ by using the following relationship.

> [!equation] Standard reaction Gibbs energy from formation free energies (298 K, 1 atm)
> $$
> \Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\sum n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { products }}^{0}-\sum n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { reactants }}^{0} \quad(1 \mathrm{~atm} \text { and } 298 \mathrm{~K} \text { only })
> $$

The value of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ allows us to predict the spontaneity of a very special hypothetical reaction that we call the standard reaction.

In the standard reaction, the numbers of moles of reactants shown in the balanced equation, all at standard conditions, are completely converted to the numbers of moles of products shown in the balanced equation, all at standard conditions.

We must remember that it is $\Delta G$, and not $\Delta G^{0}$, that is the general criterion for spontaneity. $\Delta G$ depends on concentrations of reactants and products in the mixture. For most reactions, there is an equilibrium mixture of reactant and product concentrations that is more stable than either all reactants or all products. In Chapter 17 we will study the concept of equilibrium and see how to find $\Delta G$ for mixtures.

We want to know which are more stable at standard conditions-the reactants or the products.

For the reverse reaction at 298 K , $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-173.1 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}$. So the reverse reaction is product-favored but very slow at room temperature. The NO formed in automobile engines is oxidized to even more harmful $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ much more rapidly than it decomposes to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thermodynamic spontaneity does not guarantee that a process occurs at an observable rate. The oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere represent a major environmental problem.

**Plan**

The reaction conditions are 1 atm and 298 K , so we can use the tabulated values of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ for each substance in Appendix K to evaluate $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ in the preceding equation. The treatment of units for calculation of $\Delta G^{0}$ is the same as that for $\Delta H^{0}$ in Example 15-9.

**Solution**

We obtain the following values of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ from Appendix K:

|  | $\mathrm{N}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ | $\mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{g})$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}, \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}:$ | 0 | 0 | 86.57 |

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =\Sigma n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { products }}^{0}-\Sigma n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { reactants }}^{0} \\
& =2 \Delta G_{\mathrm{fNO}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0} \quad-\left[\Delta G_{\mathrm{fN}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0}+\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0}\right] \\
& =2(86.57) \quad-[0+0] \\
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =+173.1 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn} \quad \text { for the reaction as written }
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $\Delta G^{0}$ is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous at 298 K under standard state conditions.

**You should now work Exercise 111.**

The value of $\Delta G^{0}$ can also be calculated by the equation

$$
\Delta G^{0}=\Delta H^{0}-T \Delta S^{0} \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

Strictly, this last equation applies to standard conditions; however, $\Delta H^{0}$ and $\Delta S^{0}$ often do not vary much with temperature, so the equation can often be used to estimate free energy changes at other temperatures.

> 1. The calculation of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ from tabulated values of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ is valid only if the reaction is at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$ and one atmosphere.

**Plan**

First we calculate $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ and $\Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$. We use the relationship $\Delta G^{0}=\Delta H^{0}-T \Delta S^{0}$ to evaluate the free energy change under standard state conditions at 298 K .

**Solution**

The values we obtain from Appendix K are

\[

\]

Now we use the relationship $\Delta G^{0}=\Delta H^{0}-T \Delta S^{0}$, with $T=298 \mathrm{~K}$, to evaluate the free energy change under standard state conditions at 298 K .

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} \quad-T \Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} \\
& =180.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}-(298 \mathrm{~K})(0.0249 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}) \\
& =180.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}-7.42 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \\
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =+173.1 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn, the same value obtained in Example 15-19. }
\end{aligned}
$$

**You should now work Exercise 113.**
