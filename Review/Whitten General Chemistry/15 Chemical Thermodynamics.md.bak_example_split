Energy is very important in every aspect of our daily lives. The food we eat supplies the energy to sustain life with all of its activities and concerns. The availability of (still) relatively inexpensive energy is an important factor in our technological society. This is seen in the costs of fuel, heating and cooling of our homes and workplaces, and electricity to power our lights, appliances, and computers. It is also seen in the costs of goods and services we purchase because a substantial part of the cost of production is for energy in one form or another. We must understand the scientific basis of the storage and use of energy to learn how to decrease our dependence on consumable oil and natural gas as our main energy sources. Such understanding will have profound ramifications, ranging from our daily lifestyles to international relations.

The concept of energy is at the very heart of science. All physical and chemical processes, including those in all living systems, are accompanied by the transfer of energy. Because energy cannot be created or destroyed, we must understand how to do the "accounting" of energy transfers from one body or one substance to another, or from one form of energy to another.

In thermodynamics we study the energy changes that accompany physical and chemical processes. These energy changes usually involve beat-hence the "thermo-" part of the term. In this chapter we study the two main aspects of thermodynamics. The first is thermochemistry. This practical subject is concerned with how we observe, measure, and predict energy changes for both physical changes and chemical reactions. The second part of the chapter addresses a more fundamental aspect of thermodynamics. There we will learn to use energy changes to tell whether or not a given process can occur under specified conditions to give predominantly products (or reactants) and how to make a process more (or less) favorable.

**Heat Changes and Thermochemistry**

# 15-1 The First Law of Thermodynamics

We can define energy as follows.

Energy is the capacity to do work or to transfer heat.

We classify energy into two general types: kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The kinetic energy of an object is equal to one half its mass, $m$, times the square of its velocity, $v$.

$$
E_{\text {kinetic }}=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

The heavier a hammer is and the more rapidly it moves, the greater its kinetic energy and the more work it can accomplish.

Potential energy is the energy that a system possesses by virtue of its position or composition. The work that we do to lift an object is stored in the object as energy; we describe this as potential energy. If we drop a hammer, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls, and it could do work on something it hits-for example, drive a nail or break a piece of glass. Similarly, an electron in an atom has potential energy because of the electrostatic force on it that is due to the positively charged nucleus and the other electrons in that atom and surrounding atoms. Energy can take many other forms: electrical energy, radiant energy (light), nuclear energy, and chemical energy. At the atomic or molecular level, we can think of each of these as either kinetic or potential energy.

The chemical energy in a fuel or food comes from potential energy stored in atoms due to their arrangements in the molecules. This stored chemical energy can be released when compounds undergo chemical changes, such as those that occur in combustion and metabolism.

Reactions that release energy in the form of heat are called exothermic reactions. Combustion reactions of fossil fuels are familiar examples of exothermic reactions. Hydrocarbons-including methane, the main component of natural gas, and octane, a minor component of gasoline-undergo combustion with an excess of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to yield $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. These reactions release heat energy. The amounts of heat energy released at constant pressure are shown for the reactions of one mole of methane and of two moles of octane.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+890 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
2 \mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{18}(\ell)+25 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \longrightarrow 16 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+18 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+1.090 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

In such reactions, the total energy of the products is lower than that of the reactants by the amount of energy released, most of which is heat. Some initial activation (e.g., by heat) is needed to get these reactions started. This is shown for $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ in Figure 15-1. This activation energy plus 890 kJ is released as one mole of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$ are formed.

A process that absorbs energy from its surroundings is called endothermic. One such process is shown in Figure 15-2.

Energy changes accompany physical changes, too (Chapter 13). For example, the melting of one mole of ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at constant pressure must be accompanied by the absorption of 6.02 kJ of energy.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~s})+6.02 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

This tells us that the total energy of the water is raised by 6.02 kJ in the form of heat during the phase change, even though the temperature remains constant.

> Figure 15-1 The difference between the potential energy of the reactants-one mole of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$-and that of the products-one mole of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and two moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$-is the amount of heat evolved in this exothermic reaction at constant pressure. For this reaction, it is $890 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of reaction. In this chapter, we see how to measure the heat absorbed or released and how to calculate it from other known heat changes. Some initial activation, by heat, for example, is needed to get the reaction started (Section 16-6). In the absence of such activation energy, a mixture of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be kept at room temperature for a long time without reacting. For an endothermic reaction, the final level is higher than the initial level.

$$

The excess ammonium nitrate dissolves in the water produced in the reaction. (b) The dissolution process is also very endothermic. If the flask is placed on a wet wooden block, the water freezes and attaches the block to the flask.

Some important ideas about energy are summarized in the First Law of Thermodynamics.
The combined amount of matter and energy in the universe is constant.

The Law of Conservation of Energy is just another statement of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions and physical changes.

State functions are represented by capital letters. Here $P$ refers to pressure, $V$ to volume, and $T$ to absolute temperature.

> Here is a graphical representation of a $\$ 150$ decrease in your bank balance. We express the change in your bank balance as $\Delta \$=\$_{\text {final }}-\$_{\text {initial }}$. Your final balance is less than your initial balance, so the result is negative, indicating a decrease. There are many ways to get this same net changeone large withdrawal or some combination of deposits, withdrawals, interest earned, and service charges. All of the $\Delta$ values we will see in this chapter can be thought of in this way.

# 15-2 Some Thermodynamic Terms

The substances involved in the chemical and physical changes that we are studying are called the system. Everything in the system's environment constitutes its surroundings. The universe is the system plus its surroundings. The system may be thought of as the part of the universe under investigation. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed; it is only transferred between the system and its surroundings.

The thermodynamic state of a system is defined by a set of conditions that completely specifies all the properties of the system. This set commonly includes the temperature, pressure, composition (identity and number of moles of each component), and physical state (gas, liquid, or solid) of each part of the system. Once the state has been specified, all other properties-both physical and chemical-are fixed.

The properties of a system-such as $P, V, T$-are called state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state of the system and not on the way in which the system came to be in that state. A change in a state function describes a difference between the two states. It is independent of the process or pathway by which the change occurs.

For instance, consider a sample of one mole of pure liquid water at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 1 atm pressure. If at some later time the temperature of the sample is $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at the same pressure, then it is in a different thermodynamic state. We can tell that the net temperature change is $-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It does not matter whether (1) the cooling took place directly (either slowly or rapidly) from $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, or (2) the sample was first heated to $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then cooled to $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and finally warmed to $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, or (3) any other conceivable path was followed from the initial state to the final state. The change in other properties (e.g., the pressure) of the sample is likewise independent of path.

The most important use of state functions in thermodynamics is to describe changes. We describe the difference in any quantity, $X$, as

$$
\Delta X=X_{\text {final }}-X_{\text {initial }}
$$

When $X$ increases, the final value is greater than the initial value, so $\Delta X$ is positive; a decrease in $X$ makes $\Delta X$ a negative value.

You can consider a state function as analogous to a bank account. With a bank account, at any time you can measure the amount of money in your account (your balance) in convenient terms-dollars and cents. Changes in this balance can occur for several reasons, such as deposit of your paycheck, writing of checks, or service charges assessed by the bank. In our analogy these transactions are not state functions, but they do cause changes in the state function (the balance in the account). You can think of the bank balance on a vertical scale; a deposit of $\$ 150$ changes the balance by $+\$ 150$, no matter what it was at the start, just as a withdrawal of $\$ 150$ would change the balance by $-\$ 150$. Similarly, we shall see that the energy of a system is a state function that can be changed-for instance, by an energy "deposit" of heat absorbed or work done on the system, or by an energy "withdrawal" of heat given off or work done by the system.

We can describe differences between levels of a state function, regardless of where the zero level is located. In the case of a bank balance, the "natural" zero level is obviously the point at which we open the account, before any deposits or withdrawals. In contrast, the zero levels on most temperature scales are set arbitrarily. When we say that the temperature of an ice-water mixture is "zero degrees Celsius," we are not saying that the mixture contains no temperature! We have simply chosen to describe this point on the temperature scale by the number zero; conditions of higher temperature are described by positive temperature values, and those of lower temperature have negative values, "below zero." The phrase "15 degrees cooler" has the same meaning anywhere on the scale. Many of the scales that we use in thermodynamics are arbitrarily defined in this way. Arbitrary scales are useful when we are interested only in changes in the quantity being described.

Any property of a system that depends only on the values of its state functions is also a state function. For instance, the volume of a given sample of water depends only on temperature, pressure, and physical state; volume is a state function. We shall encounter other thermodynamic state functions.

# 15-3 Enthalpy Changes

Most chemical reactions and physical changes occur at constant (usually atmospheric) pressure.

The quantity of heat transferred into or out of a system as it undergoes a chemical or physical change at constant pressure, $q_{\mathrm{p}}$, is defined as the enthalpy change, $\Delta \boldsymbol{H}$, of the process.

An enthalpy change is sometimes loosely referred to as a heat change or a heat of reaction. The enthalpy change is equal to the enthalpy or "heat content," $H$, of the substances produced minus the enthalpy of the substances consumed.

$$
\Delta H=H_{\text {final }}-H_{\text {initial }} \quad \text { or } \quad \Delta H=H_{\text {substances produced }}-H_{\text {substances consumed }}
$$

It is impossible to know the absolute enthalpy (heat content) of a system. Enthalpy is a state function, however, and it is the change in enthalpy in which we are interested; this can be measured for many processes. In the next several sections, we focus on chemical reactions and the enthalpy changes that occur in these processes. We first discuss the experimental determination of enthalpy changes.

# 15-4 Calorimetry

We can determine the energy change associated with a chemical or physical process by using an experimental technique called calorimetry. This technique is based on observing the temperature change when a system absorbs or releases energy in the form of heat. The experiment is carried out in a device called a calorimeter, in which the temperature change of a known amount of substance (often water) of known specific heat is measured. The temperature change is caused by the absorption or release of heat by the chemical or physical process under study. A review of calculations involved with heat transfer (Sections 1-14, 13-9, and 13-11) will help you understand this section.

A "coffee-cup" calorimeter (Figure 15-3) is often used in laboratory classes to measure "heats of reaction" at constant pressure, $q_{\mathrm{p}}$, in aqueous solutions. Reactions are chosen so that there are no gaseous reactants or products. Thus, all reactants and products remain in the vessel throughout the experiment. Such a calorimeter could be used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released when a reaction takes place in aqueous solution. We can consider the reactants and products as the system and the calorimeter plus the solution (mostly water) as the surroundings. For an exothermic reaction, the amount of heat evolved by the reaction can be calculated from the amount by which it causes the temperature of the calorimeter and the solution to rise. The heat can be visualized as divided into two parts.

$$
\binom{\text { amount of heat }}{\text { released by reaction }}=\binom{\text { amount of heat absorbed }}{\text { by calorimeter }}+\binom{\text { amount of heat }}{\text { absorbed by solution }}
$$

The amount of heat absorbed by a calorimeter is sometimes expressed as the heat capacity of the calorimeter, in joules per degree. The heat capacity of a calorimeter is determined by adding a known amount of heat and measuring the rise in temperature of the calorimeter and of the solution it contains. This heat capacity of a calorimeter is sometimes called its calorimeter constant.

The symbol $q$ represents the amount of heat absorbed by the system. The subscript p indicates a constant-pressure process.

The polystyrene insulation of the simple coffee-cup calorimeter ensures that little heat escapes from or enters the container.

One way to add heat is to use an electric heater.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> Note that, because we are using the change in temperature ( $\Delta T$ ) in this example, temperatures can be expressed as ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or K . That is because the magnitude of $a$ change of $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is equal to 1 K . In this problem $\Delta T=14.40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=$ 14.40 K . But, when working with mathematical equations that use absolute temperatures $T$ (not $\Delta T!)$, it is important to express temperatures in kelvins. In this chapter, we will see mathematical formulas that use $T$ and $\Delta T$, so it is important to keep track of which is being used.

# 15-5 Thermochemical Equations

A balanced chemical equation, written together with a description of the corresponding heat change, is called a thermochemical equation. For example,

$$
\underset{1 \mathrm{~mol}}{\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)}+\underset{3 \mathrm{~mol}}{3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})} \longrightarrow \underset{2 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}+\underset{3 \mathrm{~mol}}{2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)}+1367 \mathrm{~kJ}
$$

is a thermochemical equation that describes the combustion (burning) of one mole of liquid ethanol at a particular temperature and pressure. The coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation must be interpreted as numbers of moles of each reactant and product. Thus, 1367 kJ of heat is released when one mole of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)$ reacts with three moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ to give two moles of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and three moles of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$. We refer to this amount of reaction as one mole of reaction, which we abbreviate "mol rxn." This interpretation allows us to write various unit factors as desired.

$$
\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}, \frac{2 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}}, \frac{1367 \mathrm{~kJ} \text { of heat released }}{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \text {, and so on }
$$

The thermochemical equation is more commonly written as

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \quad \Delta H=-1367 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

The negative sign indicates that this is an exothermic reaction (i.e., it gives off heat).

# 15-6 Standard States and Standard Enthalpy Changes

The thermodynamic standard state of a substance is its most stable pure form under standard pressure (one atmosphere)* and at some specific temperature ( $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or 298 K unless otherwise specified). Examples of elements in their standard states at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ are hydrogen, gaseous diatomic molecules, $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$; mercury, a silver-colored liquid metal, $\mathrm{Hg}(\ell)$; sodium, a silvery-white solid metal, $\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{s})$; and carbon, a grayish-black solid called graphite, C(graphite). We use C(graphite) instead of C(s) to distinguish it from other solid forms of carbon, such as C (diamond). The reaction C (diamond) $\longrightarrow \mathrm{C}$ (graphite) would be exothermic by 1.897 $\mathrm{kJ} /$ mol rxn; C(graphite) is thus more stable than C(diamond). Examples of standard states of compounds include ethanol (ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol), a liquid, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)$; water, a liquid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$; calcium carbonate, a solid, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$; and carbon dioxide, a gas, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$. Keep in mind the following conventions for thermochemical standard states.

1. For a pure substance in the liquid or solid phase, the standard state is the pure liquid or solid.
2. For a gas, the standard state is the gas at a pressure of one atmosphere; in a mixture of gases, its partial pressure must be one atmosphere.
3. For a substance in solution, the standard state refers to one-molar concentration.

For ease of comparison and tabulation, we often refer to thermochemical or thermodynamic changes "at standard states" or, more simply, to a standard change. To indicate a change at standard pressure, we add a superscript zero. If some temperature other than the standard temperature of $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$ is specified, we indicate it with a subscript; if no subscript appears, a temperature of $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( 298 K ) is implied.

[^0]The standard enthalpy change, $\Delta \boldsymbol{H}_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$, for a reaction
reactants ⟶ products
refers to the $\Delta H$ when the specified number of moles of reactants, all at standard states, are converted completely to the specified number of moles of products, all at standard states.

We allow a reaction to take place, with changes in temperature or pressure if necessary; when the reaction is complete, we return the products to the same conditions of temperature and pressure that we started with, keeping track of energy or enthalpy changes as we do so. When we describe a process as taking place "at constant $T$ and $P$," we mean that the initial and final conditions are the same. Because we are dealing with changes in state functions, the net change is the same as the change we would have obtained hypothetically with $T$ and $P$ actually held constant.

# 15-7 Standard Molar Enthalpies of Formation, $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{H}_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$

It is not possible to determine the total enthalpy content of a substance on an absolute scale. Because we need to describe only changes in this state function, we can define an arbitrary scale as follows.

> The standard molar enthalpy of formation, $\Delta \boldsymbol{H}_{\mathbf{f}}^{\mathbf{0}}$, of a substance is the enthalpy change for the reaction in which one mole of the substance in a specified state is formed from its elements in their standard states. By convention, the $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ value for any element in its standard state is zero.

Standard molar enthalpy of formation is often called standard molar heat of formation or, more simply, heat of formation. The superscript zero in $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ signifies standard pressure, 1 atmosphere. Negative values for $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ describe exothermic formation reactions, whereas positive values for $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ describe endothermic formation reactions.

The enthalpy change for a balanced equation that gives a compound from its elements does not necessarily give a molar enthalpy of formation for the compound. Consider the following exothermic reaction at standard conditions.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-72.8 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

We see that two moles of $\operatorname{HBr}(\mathrm{g})$ are formed in the reaction as written. Half as much energy, 36.4 kJ , is liberated when one mole of $\mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{g})$ is produced from its constituent elements in their standard states. For $\operatorname{HBr}(\mathrm{g}), \Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}=-36.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. This can be shown by dividing all coefficients in the balanced equation by 2 .

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0} & =-36.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn} \\
\Delta H_{\mathrm{fHBr}(\mathrm{~g})}^{0} & =-36.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{HBr}(\mathrm{~g})
\end{aligned}
$$

Standard heats of formation of some common substances are tabulated in Table 15-1. Appendix K contains a more extensive listing.

When referring to a thermodynamic quantity for a substance, we often omit the description of the substance from the units. Units for tabulated $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ values are given as " $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ "; we must interpret this as "per mole of the substance in the specified state." For instance, for
$\operatorname{HBr}(\mathrm{g})$ the tabulated $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ value of $-36.4 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ should be interpreted as $\frac{-36.4 \mathrm{~kJ}}{\operatorname{mol} \operatorname{HBr}(\mathrm{~g})}$.

This is sometimes referred to as the standard heat of reaction.

We can think of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ as the enthalpy content of each substance, in its standard state, relative to the enthalpy content of the elements, in their standard states. This is why $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ for an element in its standard state is zero.

The coefficients $\frac{1}{2}$ preceding $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell)$ do not imply half a molecule of each. In thermochemical equations, the coefficients always refer to the number of moles under consideration.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> 
> The $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ values of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and C (diamond) are not equal to 0 at 298 K . This is because the standard states of these elements are $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell)$ and C (graphite), respectively.

# 15-8 Hess's Law

In 1840, G. H. Hess (1802-1850) published his law of heat summation, which he derived on the basis of numerous thermochemical observations.

The enthalpy change for a reaction is the same whether it occurs by one step or by any series of steps.

Enthalpy is a state function. Its change is therefore independent of the pathway by which a reaction occurs. We do not need to know whether the reaction does, or even can, occur by the series of steps used in the calculation. The steps must (if only "on paper") result in the overall reaction. Hess's Law lets us calculate enthalpy changes for reactions for which the changes could be measured only with difficulty, if at all. In general terms, Hess's Law of heat summation may be represented as

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\Delta H_{\mathrm{a}}^{0}+\Delta H_{\mathrm{b}}^{0}+\Delta H_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}+\cdots
$$

Here $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}, \ldots$ refer to balanced thermochemical equations that can be summed to give the equation for the desired reaction.

Consider the following reaction.

$$
\mathrm{C} \text { (graphite) }+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=?
$$

The enthalpy change for this reaction cannot be measured directly. Even though $\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ is the predominant product of the reaction of graphite with a limited amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$, some $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ is always produced as well. The following reactions do go to completion with excess $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$; therefore, $\Delta H^{0}$ values have been measured experimentally for them. [Pure $\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ is readily available.]

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{C} \text { (graphite) }+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-393.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn} \\
\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-283.0 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can "work backward" to find out how to combine these two known equations to obtain the desired equation. We want one mole of CO on the right, so we reverse equation (2) [designated below as (-2)]; heat is then absorbed instead of released, so we must change the sign of its $\Delta H^{0}$ value. Then we add it to equation (1), canceling equal numbers of moles of the same species on each side. This gives the equation for the reaction we want. Adding the corresponding enthalpy changes gives the enthalpy change we seek.

$$
\begin{array}{rr} 
& \Delta \boldsymbol{H}^{0} \\
\text { C(graphite) }+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & -393.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}) \\
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{~g})+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) & -(-283.0 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}) \\
\hline \text { C(graphite) }+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{~g}) & \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-110.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
\end{array}
$$

This equation shows the formation of one mole of $\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ in its standard state from the elements in their standard states. In this way, we determine that $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ for $\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ is $-110.5 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$.

This reaction, however, does not involve formation of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)$ from its constituent elements; therefore, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is not $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ for $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)$.

But the element must be in its most stable form. Thus, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ for $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ is zero, because ordinary oxygen is gaseous and diatomic. We would not assume that $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ would be zero for oxygen atoms, $\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$, or for ozone, $\mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})$. Similarly, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ is zero for $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$ and for $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell)$, but not for $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$.

# 15-9 Bond Energies

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of chemical bonds. Energy is always required to break a chemical bond (Section 7-4). Often this energy is supplied in the form of heat.

The bond energy (B.E.) is the amount of energy necessary to break one mole of bonds in a gaseous covalent substance to form products in the gaseous state at constant temperature and pressure.

The greater the bond energy, the more stable (stronger) the bond is, and the harder it is to break. Thus bond energy is a measure of bond strengths.

Consider the following reaction.

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\Delta H_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}}=+436 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H} \text { bonds }
$$

The bond energy of the hydrogen-hydrogen bond is $436 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of bonds. In other words, 436 kJ of energy must be absorbed for every mole of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds that are broken. This endothermic reaction ( $\Delta H_{\text {rxn }}^{0}$ is positive) can be written

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+436 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

For all practical purposes, the bond energy is the same as bond enthalpy. Tabulated values of average bond energies are actually average bond enthalpies. We use the term "bond energy" rather than "bond enthalpy" because it is common practice to do so.

We have discussed these changes in terms of absorption or release of heat. Another way of breaking bonds is by absorption of light energy (Chapter 4). Bond energies can be determined from the energies of the photons that cause bond dissociation.

> [!note] Stop and Think
> 
> Remember that this equation involves bond energies of reactants minus bond energies of products.

Some average bond energies are listed in Tables 15-2 and 15-3. We see from Table 15-3 that for any combination of elements, a triple bond is stronger than a double bond, which in turn is stronger than a single bond. Bond energies for double and triple bonds are not simply two or three times those for the corresponding single bonds. A single bond is a $\sigma$ bond, whereas double and triple bonds involve a combination of $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bonding. The bond energy measures the difficulty of overcoming the orbital overlap, and we should not expect the strength of a $\pi$ bond to be the same as that of a $\sigma$ bond between the same two atoms.

We should keep in mind that each of the values listed is the average bond energy from a variety of compounds. The average $C-H$ bond energy is $413 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ of bonds. Average $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond energies differ slightly from compound to compound, as in $\mathrm{CH}_{4}, \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}$, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NO}_{2}$, and so on. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently constant to be useful in estimating thermodynamic data that are not readily available by another approach. Values of $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ estimated in this way are not as reliable as those obtained from $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ values for the substances involved in the reaction.

A special case of Hess's Law involves the use of bond energies to estimate heats of reaction. Consider the enthalpy diagrams in Figure 15-5. In general terms, $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is related to the bond energies of the reactants and products in gas phase reactions by the following version of Hess's Law.

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\Sigma \mathrm{B} . \mathrm{E}_{. \text {reactants }}-\Sigma \mathrm{B} . \mathrm{E}_{. \text {products }} \quad \text { in gas phase reactions only }
$$

The net enthalpy change of a reaction is the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in reactant molecules minus the amount of energy required to break all the bonds in product molecules. Stated in another way, the amount of energy released when a

bond is formed is equal to the amount absorbed when the same bond is broken. The heat of reaction for a gas phase reaction can be described as the amount of energy released in forming all the bonds in the products minus the amount of energy released in forming all the bonds in the reactants (Figure 15-5). This heat of reaction can be estimated using the average bond energies in Tables 15-2 and 15-3.

The definition of bond energies is limited to the bond-breaking process only, and does not include any provision for changes of state. Thus, it is valid only for substances in the gaseous state. The calculations of this section therefore apply only when all substances in the reaction are gases. If liquids or solids were involved, then additional information such as heats of vaporization and fusion would be needed to account for phase changes.

# 15-10 Changes in Internal Energy, $\Delta E$

The internal energy, $\boldsymbol{E}$, of a specific amount of a substance represents all the energy contained within the substance. It includes such forms as kinetic energies of the molecules; energies of attraction and repulsion among subatomic particles, atoms, ions, or molecules; and other forms of energy. The internal energy of a collection of molecules is a state function. The difference between the internal energy of the products and the internal energy of the reactants of a chemical reaction or physical change, $\Delta E$, is given by the equation

$$
\Delta E=E_{\text {final }}-E_{\text {initial }}=E_{\text {products }}-E_{\text {reactants }}=q+w
$$

The terms $q$ and $w$ represent heat and work, respectively. These are two ways in which energy can flow into or out of a system. Work involves a change of energy in which a body is moved through a distance, $d$, against some force, $f$; that is, $w=f d$.

$$
\Delta E=\text { (amount of heat absorbed by system) }+ \text { (amount of work done on system) }
$$

> 
> The following conventions apply to the signs of $q$ and $w$.
> 
> $q$ is positive: Heat is absorbed by the system from the surroundings (endothermic).
> 
> $q$ is negative: Heat is released by the system to the surroundings (exothermic).

Whenever a given amount of energy is added to or removed from a system, either as heat or as work, the energy of the system changes by that same amount. The equation $\Delta E=q+w$ is another way of expressing the First Law of Thermodynamics (Section 15-1).

The only type of work involved in most chemical and physical changes is pressurevolume work. From dimensional analysis we can see that the product of pressure and volume is work. Pressure is the force exerted per unit area, where area is distance squared, $d^{2}$; volume is distance cubed, $d^{3}$. Thus, the product of pressure and volume is force times distance, which is work. An example of a physical change (a phase change) in which the system expands and thus does work as it absorbs heat is shown in Figure 15-6. Even if the book had not been present, the expanding system pushing against the atmosphere would have done work for the expansion.

When energy is released by a reacting system, $\Delta E$ is negative; energy can be written as a product in the equation for the reaction. When the system absorbs energy from the surroundings, $\Delta E$ is positive; energy can be written as a reactant in the equation.

For example, the complete combustion of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ at constant volume at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ releases energy.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\underset{\text { indicates release of energy }}{2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+887 \mathrm{~kJ}}
$$

We can write the change in energy that accompanies this reaction as

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \quad \Delta E=-887 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}
$$

As discussed in Section 15-2, the negative sign indicates a decrease in energy of the system, or a release of energy by the system.

The reverse of this reaction absorbs energy. It can be written as
or

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)+887 \mathrm{~kJ} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})
$$

indicates absorption of energy

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \quad \Delta E=+887 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

If the latter reaction could be forced to occur, the system would have to absorb 887 kJ of energy per mole of reaction from its surroundings.

When a gas is produced against constant external pressure, such as in an open vessel at atmospheric pressure, the gas does work as it expands against the pressure of the atmosphere. If no heat is absorbed during the expansion, the result is a decrease in the internal

> Active Figure 15-6 A system that absorbs heat and does work. (a) Some powdered dry ice (solid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) is placed into a flexible bag, which is then sealed. (b) As the dry ice absorbs heat from the surroundings, some solid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sublimes to form gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The larger volume of the gas causes the bag to expand. The expanding gas does the work of raising a book that has been placed on the bag. Work would be done by the expansion, even if the book were not present, as the bag pushes against the surrounding atmosphere. The heat absorbed by such a process at constant pressure, $q_{p}$, is equal to $\Delta H$ for the process.

> 
> $V_{2}$ is the final volume, and $V_{1}$ is the initial volume.
Let us illustrate the latter case. Consider the complete reaction of a 2:1 mole ratio of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to produce steam at some constant temperature above $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and at one atmosphere pressure (Figure 15-7).

$$
2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{~g})+\text { heat }
$$

Assume that the constant-temperature bath surrounding the reaction vessel completely absorbs all the evolved heat so that the temperature of the gases does not change. The volume of the system decreases by one third ( 3 mol gaseous reactants $\rightarrow 2 \mathrm{~mol}$ gaseous products). The surroundings exert a constant pressure of one atmosphere and do work on the system by compressing it. The internal energy of the system increases by an amount equal to the amount of work done on it.

The work done on or by a system depends on the external pressure and the volume. When the external pressure is constant during a change, the amount of work done is equal to this pressure times the change in volume. The work done on a system equals $-P \Delta V$ or $-P\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$.

| Compression (volume decreases) | Expansion (volume increases) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Work is done $b y$ the surroundings on the system, so the sign of $w$ is positive | Work is done by the system on the surroundings, so the sign of $w$ is negative |
| $V_{2}$ is less than $V_{1}$, so $\Delta V=\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$ is negative | $V_{2}$ is greater than $V_{1}$, so $\Delta V=\left(V_{2}-V_{1}\right)$ is positive |
| Can be due to a decrease in number of moles of gas ( $\Delta n$ negative) | Can be due to an increase in number of moles of gas ( $\Delta n$ positive) |

We substitute $-P \Delta V$ for $w$ in the equation $\Delta E=q+w$ to obtain

$$
\Delta E=q-P \Delta V
$$

In constant-volume reactions, no $P \Delta V$ work is done. Volume does not change, so nothing "moves through a distance," and $d=0$ and $f d=0$. The change in internal energy of the system is just the amount of heat absorbed or released at constant volume, $q_{\mathrm{v}}$.

$$
\Delta E=q_{\mathrm{v}}
$$

Figure 15-8 shows the same phase change process as in Figure 15-6, but at constant volume condition, so no work is done.

Solids and liquids do not expand or contract significantly when the pressure changes $(\Delta V \approx 0)$. In reactions in which equal numbers of moles of gases are produced and consumed at constant temperature and pressure, essentially no work is done. By the ideal gas equation, $P \Delta V=(\Delta n) R T$ and $\Delta n=0$, where $\Delta n$ equals the number of moles of gaseous products minus the number of moles of gaseous reactants. Thus, the work term $w$ has a significant value at constant pressure only when there are different numbers of moles of gaseous products and reactants so that the volume of the system changes.

# 15-11 Relationship Between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta E$

The fundamental definition of enthalpy, $H$, is

$$
H=E+P V
$$

For a process at constant temperature and pressure,

$$
\Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

From Section 15-10, we know that $\Delta E=q+w$, so

$$
\Delta H=q+w+P \Delta V \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

At constant pressure, $w=-P \Delta V$, so

$$
\Delta H=q+(-P \Delta V)+P \Delta V
$$

$$
\Delta H=q_{p} \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

The difference between $\Delta E$ and $\Delta H$ is the amount of expansion work ( $P \Delta V$ work) that the system can do. Unless there is a change in the number of moles of gas present, this difference is extremely small and can usually be neglected. For an ideal gas, $P V=n R T$. At constant temperature and constant pressure, $P \Delta V=(\Delta n) R T$, a work term. Substituting gives

$$
\Delta H=\Delta E+(\Delta n) R T \quad \text { or } \quad \Delta E=\Delta H-(\Delta n) R T \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$


> [!tip] Problem-Solving Tip: Two equations relate $\Delta H$ and $\Delta E$
> The relationship $\Delta H=\Delta E+P \Delta V$ is valid for any process that takes place at constant temperature and pressure. It is very useful for physical changes that involve volume changes, such as expansion or compression of a gas.
> 
> When a chemical reaction occurs and causes a change in the number of moles of gas, it is more convenient to use the relationship in the form $\Delta H=\Delta E+(\Delta n) R T$. You should always remember that $\Delta n$ refers to the change in the number of moles of gas in the balanced chemical equation.

In Example 15-14 we found that the change in internal energy, $\Delta E$, for the combustion of ethanol is $-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$ ethanol at 298 K . Combustion of one mole of ethanol at 298 K and constant pressure releases 1367 kJ of heat. Therefore (Section 15-5)

$$
\Delta H=-1367 \frac{\mathrm{~kJ}}{\mathrm{~mol} \text { ethanol }}
$$

The difference between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta E$ is due to the work term, $-P \Delta V$ or $-(\Delta n) R T$. In this balanced equation there are fewer moles of gaseous products than of gaseous reactants: $\Delta n=2-3=-1$.

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}(\ell)+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)
$$

Thus, the atmosphere does work on the system (compresses it). Let us find the work done on the system per mole of reaction.

$$
\begin{aligned}
w & =-P \Delta V=-(\Delta n) R T \\
& =-(-1 \mathrm{~mol})\left(\frac{8.314 \mathrm{~J}}{\mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~K}}\right)(298 \mathrm{~K})=+2.48 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} \\
w & =+2.48 \mathrm{~kJ} \quad \text { or } \quad(\Delta n) R T=-2.48 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can now calculate $\Delta E$ for the reaction from $\Delta H$ and $(\Delta n) R T$ values.

$$
\Delta E=\Delta H-(\Delta n) R T=[-1367-(-2.48)]=-1365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \text { rxn }
$$

This value agrees with the result that we obtained in Example 15-14. The size of the work term ( +2.48 kJ ) is very small compared with $\Delta H(-1367 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn})$. This is true for many reactions. Of course, if $\Delta n=0$, then $\Delta H=\Delta E$, and the same amount of heat would be absorbed or given off by the reaction whether it is carried out at constant pressure or at constant volume.

**Spontaneity of Physical and Chemical Changes**

Another major concern of thermodynamics is predicting whether a particular process can occur under specified conditions to give predominantly products. We may summarize this concern in the question "Which would be more stable at the given conditions-the reactants or the products?" A change for which the collection of products is thermodynamically more stable than the collection of reactants under the given conditions is said to be product-favored, or spontaneous, under those conditions. A change for which the products are thermodynamically less stable than the reactants under the given conditions is described as reactant-favored, or nonspontaneous, under those conditions. Some changes are spontaneous under all conditions; others are nonspontaneous under all conditions. The great majority of changes, however, are spontaneous under some conditions but not under others. We use thermodynamics to predict conditions for which the latter type of reactions can occur to give predominantly products.

The concept of spontaneity has a specific interpretation in thermodynamics. A spontaneous chemical reaction or physical change is one that can happen without any continuing outside influence. Examples are the loss of heat by a hot metal to its cooler surroundings, the rusting of a piece of iron, the expansion of a gas into a larger volume, or the melting of ice at room temperature. Such changes have a tendency to occur without being driven by an external influence. We can think of a spontaneous process as one for which products are favored over reactants at the specified conditions. The reverse of each of the spontaneous changes just listed is nonspontaneous at the same conditions, that is, it does not occur naturally. We can, however, cause some nonspontaneous changes to occur. For example, forcing an electric current through a block of metal can heat it to a temperature higher than that of its surroundings. We can compress a gas into a smaller volume by pressing on it with a piston. But to cause a process to occur in its nonspontaneous direction, we must influence it from outside the system; that is, work must be done on the system.

Although a spontaneous reaction might occur rapidly, thermodynamic spontaneity is not related to speed. The fact that a process is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable rate. It may occur rapidly, at a moderate rate, or very slowly. The rate at which a spontaneous reaction occurs is addressed by kinetics (Chapter 16).

We now study the factors that influence spontaneity of a physical or chemical change.

# 15-12 The Two Aspects of Spontaneity

Many product-favored reactions are exothermic. For instance, the combustion (burning) reactions of hydrocarbons such as methane and octane are all exothermic and highly product-favored (spontaneous). The total enthalpy content of the products is lower than that of the reactants. Not all exothermic changes are spontaneous, however, nor are all spontaneous changes exothermic. As an example, consider the freezing of water, which is an exothermic process (heat is released). This process is spontaneous at temperatures below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but we know it is not spontaneous at temperatures above $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Likewise, we know there are conditions at which the melting of ice, an endothermic

The positive sign for $w$ is consistent with the fact that work is done on the system. The balanced equation involves one mole of ethanol, so this is the amount of work done when one mole of ethanol undergoes combustion.

process, is spontaneous. Spontaneity is favored but not required when heat is released during a chemical reaction or a physical change.

There is another factor that also plays a fundamental role in determining spontaneity. Let's think about two spontaneous processes. Figure 15-10 shows what happens when two gas samples at the same pressure are allowed to mix. The molecules move randomly throughout the two containers to mix the gases (a spontaneous process). We don't expect the more homogeneous sample in Figure 15-10b to spontaneously "unmix" to give the arrangement in Figure 15-10a (a nonspontaneous process).

> A hot piece of metal is placed into cooler water. Heat is transferred spontaneously from the hotter metal to the cooler water, until the two are at the same temperature (the condition of thermal equilibrium).
> 
> As a hot metal cools, some of the energy of its vibrating atoms is transferred to the surroundings (a spontaneous process). This warms the surroundings until the two temperatures are equal. We do not expect to observe the reverse process in which energy is transferred from the surroundings to a block of metal, originally at the same temperature, to raise the temperature of the metal (a nonspontaneous process).

In these examples, we see that energy and matter tend to become dispersed (spread out). We shall see that this dispersal is a fundamental driving force that affects the spontaneity of any process.

Two factors affect the spontaneity of any physical or chemical change:

1. Spontaneity is favored when heat is released during the change (exothermic).
2. Spontaneity is favored when the change causes an increase in the dispersal of energy and matter.

The balance of these two effects is considered in Section 15-16.

# 15-13 Dispersal of Energy and Matter

## Dispersal of Energy

The dispersal of energy in a system results in the energy being spread over many particles rather than being concentrated in just a few.

To understand this concept, think about a system consisting of just two molecules, A and B , with a total of two units of energy. Denoting one unit of energy with an*, we can list the three ways to distribute these two energy units over the two molecules as

A** (Molecule A has two units of energy, B has none.)
A*B* (Each molecule has one unit of energy.)
B** (Molecule B has two units of energy, A has none.)
Suppose these two molecules are mixed with two other molecules, C and D, that initially have no energy. When collisions occur, energy can be transferred from one molecule to another. Now the energy can be dispersed among the four molecules in ten different ways:

$$
\mathrm{A}^{* *} \mathrm{~B}^{* *} \mathrm{C}^{* *} \mathrm{D}^{* *} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{~A}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*} \mathrm{C}^{*} \mathrm{D}^{*}
$$

Now there are obviously more ways (ten) the energy can be dispersed than before. In only three of these ways would all of the energy be distributed as before-A**, $\mathrm{A}^{*} \mathrm{~B}^{*}$, and $\mathrm{B}^{* *}$. Put another way, there is only a $3 / 10$ probability that the energy will be restricted to the original molecules, A and B. There are seven ways out of ten, or a probability of 7/10, that at least some of the energy has been transferred to C or D.

What would happen if large numbers of molecules were present, as in any real sample? The probability that the energy is dispersed would be huge, and there would be only an infinitesimally small chance that all of the energy would be concentrated in one or a few molecules. This reasoning leads us to an important conclusion.

If energy can be dispersed over a larger number of particles, it will be.

To see what happens if there is more energy to distribute (as at a higher temperature), let's consider another system with four molecules, but with two of the molecules (A and B) initially having three units of energy and the other two (C and D) initially with no energy, as shown in Figure 15-11a. When these molecules are brought together and allowed to exchange energy by colliding, the energy can be distributed in a total of 84 different ways,

> [!figure]

> Figure 15-11 Possible ways of distributing six quanta of energy among four molecules. (a) Initially four molecules are separated from each other. Two molecules each have three quanta of energy, and the other two have none. A total of six quanta of energy will be distributed once the molecules interact. (b) Once the molecules begin to interact, there are nine ways to distribute the six available quanta. Each of these arrangements will have multiple ways of distributing the energy among the four molecules. (c) The six different ways to arrange four molecules (A, B, C, and D) such that two molecules have two quanta of energy and the other two have one quanta of energy.

as shown in Figure 15-11b. For example, one molecule can have all six units of energy and the other three have no energy, as shown in the leftmost drawing of Figure 15-11b; the six-unit molecule could be any one of the four, so there are four ways to achieve this arrangement. Thus, the probability is only $4 / 84$ (or $1 / 21$ ) that all of the energy of the system is concentrated in one molecule. There are six ways to distribute the energy to arrive at the rightmost drawing (Figure 15-11c). Some of the other energy distributions can be achieved in many more ways, leading to a much higher probability for their occurrence. This leads to a broader statement of our earlier conclusion.

The greater the number of molecules and the higher the total energy of the system, the less likely the energy will be concentrated in a few molecules. Therefore, the energy will be more dispersed.

This generalization provides the molecular explanation behind the Maxwellian distribution of molecular speeds (kinetic energies) that was discussed in Section 12-13 (Active Figure 12-9) and in relation to evaporation and vapor pressures of liquids in Sections 13-6 and 13-7.

## Dispersal of Matter

Let us apply the idea of dispersal to the arrangements of matter and its molecules. Our experience tells us that a gas originally confined in a bulb (Figure 15-12a) will expand freely into a vacuum (Figure 15-12b). We don't expect the gas then to condense spontaneously into only one bulb. We can consider this expansion from the molecular point of view.

Suppose there are four molecules of gas in the two-part container of Figure 15-13. The probability that a particular molecule is on the left at any given time is $\frac{1}{2}$. A second specific molecule has its own probability of $\frac{1}{2}$ of being on the left, so the probability that both of these are on the left at the same time is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$. There are 16 ways that the molecules can be arranged in this container. But in only one of these arrangements are all four molecules in the left-hand portion of the container. The probability of that "condensed" arrangement is

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{4}=\frac{1}{16}
$$

We see that there is only a small likelihood that this gas would spontaneously condense to the left side of the container.

> Figure 15-12 The expansion of a gas into a vacuum. (a) The stopcock is closed, keeping all of the gas in the left bulb; the right bulb is empty (a vacuum). (b) When the stopcock is opened, the gas expands to fill the entire available volume, with half of the gas in each bulb.

Similar reasoning shows that the probability of one mole, or $6.0 \times 10^{23}$ molecules, spontaneously condensing into the left-hand bulb of Figure 15-12 would be

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \ldots \times \frac{1}{2}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6.0 \times 10^{23}}=\frac{1}{2^{6.0 \times 10^{23}}}
$$

Without writing the number in the denominator explicitly, we can mention that it is larger than the number of molecules in the entire universe! Thus there is virtually no chance that all $6.0 \times 10^{23}$ molecules in a mole of gas would spontaneously condense to half the available volume, leaving no molecules in the other half.

The dispersal of matter, as in the expansion of a gas, also often contributes to energy dispersal. Consider the expansion of a gas into a vacuum, as shown in Figure 15-14. When the gas is allowed to occupy the larger volume in Figure 15-14b, its energy levels become closer together than in the smaller volume of Figure 15-14a. This means that there are even more ways for the expanded gas to disperse its energy to arrive at the same total energy. The concept of dispersal of energy thus also predicts that the gas is far more likely to exist in the expanded state of Figure 15-14b, and we would not expect it to condense spontaneously to occupy only one chamber as in Figure 15-14a. Similar reasoning helps us to describe the spontaneous mixing of two gases in Figure 15-10. Each gas can have its energy more dispersed in its own more closely spaced energy levels when expanded into both containers. But in addition, the molecules of one gas can transfer energy to the molecules of the other gas by collision. This results in an even larger number of ways for the total energy of the mixture to be dispersed, leading to a much higher probability that the gases will be mixed (Figure 15-10a) than unmixed (Figure 15-10b). Thus the spatial dispersal of matter also results in a greater dispersal of energy.

When a soluble substance dissolves in a liquid, the solute particles become dispersed in the solvent (Sections 14-1 through 14-4). This allows the particles to transfer energy to one another, giving a larger number of ways of distributing the same total energy than if the substances remained in separate phases. In this case, too, dispersal of the two kinds of matter in one another allows more dispersal of energy. In more general terms, we often describe the dispersal of matter as an increase in disorder.

To summarize the conclusions of this section:
The final state of a system can be more probable than its initial state (spontaneous, product-favored) in either or both of two ways:

1. Energy can be dispersed over a greater number and variety of molecules.
2. The particles of the system can be more dispersed (more disordered).

# 15-14 Entropy, $S$, and Entropy Change, $\Delta S$

The dispersal of energy and matter is described by the thermodynamic state function entropy, $\boldsymbol{S}$. In the most fundamental description, the greater the energy dispersal in a system, the higher is its entropy. We have said that greater disorder (dispersal of matter, both in space and in variety) can lead to greater dispersal of energy, and hence to higher entropy. This connection allows us to discuss many entropy changes in terms of increases or decreases in the disorder and the energy dispersal of the system. Let us first see how entropy is tabulated and how entropy changes are calculated.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics establishes the zero of the entropy scale.

> The entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance (perfectly ordered) is zero at absolute zero ( 0 K ).

As the temperature of a substance increases, the particles vibrate more vigorously, so the entropy increases (Figure 15-15). Further heat input causes either increased temperature (still higher entropy) or phase transitions (melting, sublimation, or boiling) that also result in higher entropy. The entropy of a substance at any condition is its absolute entropy, also called standard molar entropy. Consider the absolute entropies at 298 K listed in Table 15-4. At 298 K , any substance is more disordered than if it were in a perfect crystalline state at absolute zero, so tabulated $S_{298}^{0}$ values for compounds and elements are always positive. Notice especially that $S_{298}^{0}$ of an element, unlike its $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$, is not equal to zero. The reference state for absolute entropy is specified by the Third Law of Thermodynamics. It is different from the reference state for $\Delta H_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ (Section 15-7). The absolute entropies, $S_{298}^{0}$, of various substances under standard conditions are tabulated in Appendix K.

Just as for other thermodynamic quantities, the entropy change for a system, $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$, is the difference between final and initial states:

$$
\Delta S_{\text {system }}=S_{\text {system, final }}-S_{\text {system, initial }}
$$

The standard entropy change, $\Delta \boldsymbol{S}^{0}$, of a reaction can be determined from the absolute entropies of reactants and products. The relationship is analogous to Hess's Law.

$$
\Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}=\Sigma n S_{\text {products }}-\Sigma n S_{\text {reactants }}
$$

> Figure 15-15 (a) A simplified representation of a side view of a "perfect" crystal of a polar substance at 0 K . Note the perfect alignment of the dipoles in all molecules in a perfect crystal. This causes its entropy to be zero at 0 K . There are no perfect crystals, however, because even the purest substances that scientists have prepared are contaminated by traces of impurities that occupy a few of the positions in the crystal structure. Additionally, there are some vacancies in the crystal structures of even very highly purified substances such as those used in semiconductors (Section 13-17). (b) A simplified representation of the same "perfect" crystal at a temperature above 0 K . Vibrations of the individual molecules within the crystal cause some dipoles to be oriented in directions other than those in a perfect arrangement. The entropy of such a crystalline solid is greater than zero because there is disorder in the crystal. Many different arrangements are possible for such a disordered array,

$S^{0}$ values are tabulated in units of $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ rather than the larger units involving kilojoules that are used for enthalpy changes. The "mol" term in the units for a substance refers to a mole of the substance, whereas for a reaction it refers to a mole of reaction. Each term in the sums on the right-hand side of the equation has the units

$$
\frac{\text { mol substance }}{\mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}} \times \frac{\mathrm{J}}{(\mathrm{~mol} \text { substance }) \cdot \mathrm{K}}=\frac{\mathrm{J}}{(\mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{rxn}) \cdot \mathrm{K}}
$$

The result is usually abbreviated as $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, or sometimes even as $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{K}$. As before, we will usually omit units in intermediate steps and then apply appropriate units to the result.

We now illustrate this calculation for a phase change and for a chemical reaction.

Although it may not appear to be, $+605.9 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ is a relatively large value of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}^{0}$. The positive entropy change favors spontaneity. This reaction is also exothermic ( $\Delta H^{0}$ is negative). As we shall see, this reaction must be spontaneous, because both factors are favorable: the reaction is exothermic ( $\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is negative) and the disorder of the system increases ( $\Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ is positive).

> Because changes in the thermodynamic quantity entropy may be understood in terms of changes in energy dispersal and molecular disorder, we can often predict the sign of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. The following illustrations emphasize several common types of processes that result in predictable entropy changes for the system.
> 
> Phase changes. In a solid, the molecules are in an ordered arrangement, where they can vibrate only around their relatively fixed positions. In a liquid, the molecules are more disordered, so they exchange energy much more freely, and the entropy is higher than in the solid. Similarly, gas molecules are in a much larger volume, and they are far less restrained than in the liquid. In the gas, they move even more randomly, both in direction and in speed; this gives any substance a much higher entropy as a gas than as a liquid or a solid (Figure 15-16). Thus the processes of melting, vaporization, and sublimation are always accompanied by an increase in entropy (Figure 15-17). The reverse processes of freezing, condensation, and deposition always correspond to a decrease in entropy.
> 
> For any substance, entropy increases in the order solid $<$ liquid $<$ gas.
> Melting, vaporization, and sublimation always have $S_{\text {system }}>0$.
> Freezing, condensation, and deposition always have $S_{\text {system }}<0$.
> 
> Temperature changes. As the temperature of any sample increases, its molecules have increased total kinetic energy; this higher energy can be dispersed among these molecules in more ways, increasing the entropy of the sample. Furthermore, the greater motion of the molecules (translational for gases and liquids, vibrational for solids) corresponds to a state of greater matter dispersal. The increased dispersal of matter and energy leads to the following result.

> The entropy of any sample increases as its temperature increases.

Which do you think results in the more positive $\Delta S$ ? Carry out the calculation using values from Appendix K to check whether your prediction was correct.
> 
> Volume changes. When the volume of a sample of gas increases, the molecules can occupy more positions, and hence are more randomly arranged (greater dispersal of matter). As pointed out in Section 15-13, the energy levels available to the molecules are closer together in the larger volume, leading to more ways to distribute the same total energy (greater dispersal of energy). Thus a gas has higher entropy at higher volume.
> 
> The entropy of a gas increases as its volume increases.
> For an increase in gas volume, $S_{\text {system }}>0$.
> 
> Mixing of substances, even without chemical reaction. Situations in which particles of more than one kind are "mixed up" are more disordered (greater dispersal of matter) and can exchange energy among both like and unlike particles (greater dispersal of energy). The entropy of the mixture is thus greater than that of the individual substances. This increase in entropy favors processes such as the mixing of gases (Figure 15-10) and the dissolving of solid and liquid solutes in liquid solvents (Figures 15-18 and 15-19; see also Section 14-2). For example, when one mole of solid NaCl dissolves in water, $\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{s}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq})$, the entropy (Appendix K) increases from $72.4 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ to $115.5 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, or $\Delta S^{0}= +43.1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. The term "mixing" can be interpreted rather liberally. For example, the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{g})$ has $\Delta S^{0}>0$; in the reactants, each atom is bonded to an identical atom, a less "mixed-up" situation than in the products, where unlike atoms are bonded together.

Values of $\Delta S^{0}$ calculated for several reactions of this type are given in Table 15-5. As you can see, the $\Delta S^{0}$ values for the dissociation process $\mathrm{X}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{X}$ are all similar for $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{F}, \mathrm{Cl}$, and N .

> $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=197.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$, can be treated as the result of two processes. The first of these is vaporization, $\operatorname{Br}_{2}(\ell) \longrightarrow \operatorname{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=93.2 \mathrm{J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$. The second step is the dissociation of gaseous bromine, $\mathrm{Br}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{g})$, for which $\Delta S^{0}=104.4 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$; this entropy increase is about the same as for the other processes that involve only dissociation of a gaseous diatomic species. Can you rationalize the even higher value given in the table for the process $\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{I}(\mathrm{g})$ ?

Example 15-16 illustrates this. There are no gaseous reactants, but the products include five moles of gas. Conversely, we would predict that the process $2 \mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$ has a negative $\Delta S^{0}$ value; here, three moles of gas is consumed while only two moles is produced, for a net decrease in the number of moles in the gas phase. You should be able to calculate the value of $\Delta S^{0}$ for this reaction from the values in Appendix K.

In more complicated molecular structures, there are more ways for the atoms to move about in three-dimensional space, so there is greater entropy. This trend is especially strong for a series of related compounds. For instance, the absolute entropy of liquid hydrogen peroxide, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(109.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ), is greater than that of liquid water, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(69.91 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})$. Gaseous $\mathrm{PCl}_{5}$ has a greater absolute entropy ( $353 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ) than gaseous $\mathrm{PCl}_{3}(311.7 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K}$ ).
> 
> Ionic compounds with similar formulas but different charges. Stronger ionic attractions (due to higher charges or closer approach) hold the ions more tightly in their crystal positions, so they vibrate less, leading to lower entropy. For instance, CaS and KCl have similar formula weights; but CaS ( $2+$ and $2-$ ionic charges ) has stronger ionic attractive forces than $\mathrm{KCl}(1+, 1-$ charges $)$, consistent with their relative entropies $\mathrm{CaS}(56.5 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})<\mathrm{KCl} (82.6 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol} \cdot \mathrm{K})$.

# 15-15 The Second Law of Thermodynamics

We now know that two factors determine whether a reaction is spontaneous under a given set of conditions. The effect of the first factor, the enthalpy change, is that spontaneity is favored (but not required) by exothermicity, and nonspontaneity is favored (but not required) by endothermicity. The effect of the other factor is summarized by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

In any spontaneous change, the universe tends toward a state of increasing entropy, $\Delta S_{\text {universe }}>0$.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics is based on our experiences, as seen by the following examples. Gases mix spontaneously. When a drop of food coloring is added to a glass of water, it diffuses until a homogeneously colored solution results. When a truck is driven down the street, it consumes fuel and oxygen, producing carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other emitted substances.

The reverse of any spontaneous change is nonspontaneous, because if it did occur, the universe would tend toward a state of lower entropy (greater order, more concentration of energy). This is contrary to our experience. A gas mixture does not spontaneously separate into its components. A colored solution does not spontaneously concentrate all of its color in a small volume. A truck cannot be driven along the street, even in reverse gear, so that it sucks up $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, water vapor, and other substances to produce fuel and oxygen.

If the entropy of a system increases during a process, the spontaneity of the process is favored but not required. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that the entropy of the universe (not the system) increases during a spontaneous process, that is,

$$
\Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}+\Delta S_{\text {surroundings }}>0 \quad \text { (spontaneous process) }
$$

Of the two ideal gas samples in Figure 15-10, the more ordered arrangement (Figure 15-10a) has lower entropy than the randomly mixed arrangement with the same volume (Figure 15-10b). Because these ideal gas samples mix without absorbing or releasing heat and without a change in total volume, they do not interact with the surroundings, so the entropy of the surroundings does not change. In this case

$$
\Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}
$$

If we open the stopcock between the two bulbs in Figure 15-10a, we expect the gases to mix spontaneously, with an increase in the disorder of the system, that is, $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$ is positive.

$$
\text { unmixed gases ⟶ mixed gases } \quad \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}>0
$$

We do not expect the more homogeneous sample in Figure 15-10b to spontaneously "unmix" to give the arrangement in Figure 15-10a (which would correspond to a decrease in $\Delta S_{\text {system }}$ ).

$$
\text { mixed gases } \longrightarrow \text { unmixed gases } \quad \Delta S_{\text {universe }}=\Delta S_{\text {system }}<0
$$

The entropy of a system can decrease during a spontaneous process or increase during a nonspontaneous process, depending on the accompanying $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$. If $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative (decrease in disorder), then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ may still be positive (overall increase in disorder) if $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is more positive than $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative. A refrigerator provides an illustration. It removes heat from inside the box (the system) and ejects that heat, plus the heat generated by the compressor, into the room (the surroundings). The entropy of the system decreases because the air molecules inside the box move more slowly. But the increase in the entropy of the surroundings more than makes up for that, so the entropy of the universe (refrigerator + room) increases.

Similarly, if $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is positive but $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is even more negative, then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is still negative. Such a process will be nonspontaneous.

Let's consider the entropy changes that occur when a liquid solidifies at a temperature below its freezing (melting) point (Figure 15-20a). $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is negative because a solid forms from its liquid, yet we know that this is a spontaneous process. A liquid releases heat to its surroundings (atmosphere) as it crystallizes. The released heat increases the motion (more disorder, greater dispersal of matter) of the molecules of the surroundings, so $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is positive. As the temperature decreases, the $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ contribution becomes more important. When the temperature is low enough (below the freezing point), the positive $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ outweighs the negative $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. Then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ becomes positive, and the freezing process becomes spontaneous.

The situation is reversed when a liquid is boiled or a solid is melted (Figure 15-20b). For example, at temperatures above its melting point, a solid spontaneously melts, the system becomes more disordered (greater dispersal of matter), and $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is positive. The heat absorbed when the solid (system) melts comes from its surroundings. This decreases the motion of the molecules of the surroundings. Thus, $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is negative (the surroundings become less disordered). The positive $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$ is greater in magnitude than the negative $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$, however, so $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive and the process is spontaneous.

Above the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for melting. Below the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for freezing. At the melting point, $\Delta S_{\text {surr }}$ is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. Then $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is zero for both melting and freezing; the system is at equilibrium. Table 15-6 lists the entropy effects for these changes of physical state.

We have said that $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ is positive for all spontaneous (product-favored) processes. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make direct measurements of $\Delta S_{\text {univ }}$ Consequently, entropy changes accompanying physical and chemical changes are reported in terms of $\Delta S_{\text {sys }}$. The subscript "sys" for system is usually omitted. The symbol $\Delta S$ refers to the change in entropy of the reacting system, just as $\Delta H$ refers to the change in enthalpy of the reacting system.

We abbreviate these subscripts as follows: system = sys, surroundings = surr, and universe = univ.

# 15-16 Free Energy Change, $\Delta G$, and Spontaneity

Energy is the capacity to do work. If heat is released in a chemical reaction ( $\Delta H$ is negative), some of the heat energy may be converted into useful work. If $\Delta S$ is negative, some of the energy must be expended to increase the order of the system. If the system becomes more disordered ( $\Delta S>0$ ), however, more useful energy becomes available than indicated by $\Delta H$ alone. J. Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), a prominent 19th-century American professor of mathematics and physics, formulated the relationship between enthalpy and entropy in terms of another state function that we now call the Gibbs free energy, $\boldsymbol{G}$. It is defined as

$$
G=H-T S
$$

The Gibbs free energy change, $\boldsymbol{\Delta} \boldsymbol{G}$, at constant temperature and pressure, is

This is often called simply the Gibbs energy change or the free energy change.

$$
\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S \quad(\text { constant } T \text { and } P)
$$

The amount by which the Gibbs free energy decreases is the maximum useful energy obtainable in the form of work from a given process at constant temperature and pressure. It is also the indicator of spontaneity of a reaction or physical change at constant $T$ and $P$. If there is a net decrease of useful energy, $\Delta G$ is negative and the process is spontaneous (product-favored). We see from the equation that $\Delta G$ becomes more negative as (1) $\Delta H$ becomes more negative (the process gives off more heat) and (2) $\Delta S$ becomes more positive (the process results in greater disorder); both factors are favorable so the process must be spontaneous.

> (a) The entropy of an organism decreases (unfavorable) when new cells are formed. The energy to sustain animal life is provided by the metabolism of food. This energy is released when the chemical bonds in the food are broken. Exhalation of gases and excretion of waste materials increase the entropy of the surroundings enough so that the entropy of the universe increases and the overall process can occur. (b) Stored chemical energy can later be transformed by the organism to the mechanical energy for muscle contraction, to the electrical energy for brain function, or to another needed form.

If there is a net increase in free energy of the system during a process, $\Delta G$ is positive and the process is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored). This means that the reverse process is spontaneous under the given conditions. When $\Delta G=0$, there is no net transfer of free energy; both the forward and reverse processes are equally favorable. Thus, $\Delta G=0$ describes a system at equilibrium.

The relationship between $\Delta G$ and spontaneity may be summarized as follows.

| $\Delta G$ | Spontaneity of Reaction (constant $T$ and $P$ ) |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |
| $\Delta G$ is positive |  | Reaction is nonspontaneous (reactant-favored) |
| $\Delta G$ is zero |  | System is at equilibrium |
| $\Delta G$ is negative |  | Reaction is spontaneous (product-favored) |
| - | 0 + |  |
| $\Delta G<0$ |  | $\Delta G>0$ |
| Reaction is spontaneous |  | Reaction is not spontaneous |
| Product-favored reaction |  | Reactant-favored reaction |
| Forward reaction is favored |  | Reverse reaction is favored |

The free energy content of a system depends on temperature and pressure (and, for mixtures, on concentrations). The value of $\Delta G$ for a process depends on the states and the concentrations of the various substances involved. It also depends strongly on temperature, because the equation $\Delta G=\Delta H-T \Delta S$ includes temperature. Just as for other thermodynamic variables, we choose some set of conditions as a standard state reference. The standard state for $\Delta G^{0}$ is the same as for $\Delta H^{0} ; 1 \mathrm{~atm}$ and the specified temperature, usually $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(298 \mathrm{~K})$. Values of standard molar free energy of formation, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$, for many substances are tabulated in Appendix K. For elements in their standard states, $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}=0$. The values of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{f}}^{0}$ may be used to calculate the standard free energy change of a reaction at 298 $K$ by using the following relationship.

$$
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=\sum n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { products }}^{0}-\sum n \Delta G_{\mathrm{f} \text { reactants }}^{0} \quad(1 \mathrm{~atm} \text { and } 298 \mathrm{~K} \text { only })
$$

The value of $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}$ allows us to predict the spontaneity of a very special hypothetical reaction that we call the standard reaction.

In the standard reaction, the numbers of moles of reactants shown in the balanced equation, all at standard conditions, are completely converted to the numbers of moles of products shown in the balanced equation, all at standard conditions.

We must remember that it is $\Delta G$, and not $\Delta G^{0}$, that is the general criterion for spontaneity. $\Delta G$ depends on concentrations of reactants and products in the mixture. For most reactions, there is an equilibrium mixture of reactant and product concentrations that is more stable than either all reactants or all products. In Chapter 17 we will study the concept of equilibrium and see how to find $\Delta G$ for mixtures.

We want to know which are more stable at standard conditions-the reactants or the products.

For the reverse reaction at 298 K , $\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}^{0}=-173.1 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{rxn}$. So the reverse reaction is product-favored but very slow at room temperature. The NO formed in automobile engines is oxidized to even more harmful $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ much more rapidly than it decomposes to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thermodynamic spontaneity does not guarantee that a process occurs at an observable rate. The oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere represent a major environmental problem.

# 15-17 The Temperature Dependence of Spontaneity

The methods developed in Section 15-16 can also be used to estimate the temperature at which a process is in equilibrium. When a system is at equilibrium, $\Delta G=0$. Thus,

$$
\Delta G_{\mathrm{rxn}}=\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}-T \Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}} \quad \text { or } \quad 0=\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}-T \Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}
$$

so

$$
\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}=T \Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}} \quad \text { or } \quad T=\frac{\Delta H_{\mathrm{rxn}}}{\Delta S_{\mathrm{rxn}}} \quad \text { (at equilibrium) }
$$

> When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ have opposite signs (classes 1 and 4), they act in the same direction, so the direction of spontaneous change does not depend on temperature. When $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ have the same signs (classes 2 and 3), their effects oppose one another, so changes in temperature can cause one factor or the other to dominate, and spontaneity depends on temperature. For class 2, decreasing the temperature decreases the importance of the unfavorable $T \Delta S$ term, so the reaction becomes product-favored at lower temperatures. For class 3 , increasing the temperature increases the importance of the favorable $T \Delta S$ term, so the reaction becomes product-favored at higher temperatures.

> 
> At temperatures above 145 K , the $T \Delta S^{0}$ term would be greater ( $-T \Delta S^{0}$ would be more negative) than the $\Delta H^{0}$ term, which would make $\Delta G^{0}$ negative; so the reaction would be producd-favored above 145 K . At temperatures below 145 K , the $T \Delta S^{0}$ term would be smaller than the $\Delta H^{0}$ term, which would make $\Delta G^{0}$ positive; so the reaction would be reactant-favored below 145 K .

> However, $145 \mathrm{~K}\left(-128^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is a very low temperature. For all practical purposes, the reaction is product-favored at all but very low temperatures. In practice, it is carried out at $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $1000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ because of the greater reaction rate at these higher temperatures. This gives a useful and economical rate of production of $\mathrm{SiCl}_{4}$, an important industrial chemical.

> 127. An ice calorimeter, shown below, can be used to measure the amount of heat released or absorbed by a reaction that is carried out at a constant temperature of $0 .{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If heat is transferred from the system to the bath, some of the ice melts. A given mass of liquid water has a smaller volume than the same mass of ice, so the total volume of the ice and water mixture decreases. Measuring the volume decrease using the scale at the left indicates the amount of heat released by the reacting system. As long as some ice remains in the bath, the temperature remains at $0 .{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. In Example 15-2 we saw that the reaction
> $\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})+2 \mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})$

(Because no gases are involved in the reaction, the volume change of the reaction mixture is negligible.) Calculate the change in volume of the ice and water mixture that would be observed if we carried out the same experiment in an ice calorimeter. The density of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\ell)$ at $0 .{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 0.99987 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}$ and that of ice is $0.917 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$.

> 149. Go to www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/ Mathematicians/Gibbs.html or another site that describes the events in the life of Josiah Willard Gibbs. (a) In what way was the doctorate degree granted to Gibbs, from whom Gibbs free energy gets its name, a first? (b) At what university did he spend nearly all his academic career?
> 150. Use the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics or another suitable reference to find the heats of formation of the following hydrocarbons: methane, ethane, propane, and $n$-butane. (a) What are the units of the values you have found? (b) Is there a trend when you compare the formula weight of each hydrocarbon with its heat of formation?
> 151. Why does $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$ have a lower entropy than $\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$ ? There are two primary qualitative reasons for this. You may have to use the chemistry library or some other source to get more information on the properties of these two common compounds to answer the question.
> 152. Steel is made by the high-temperature reaction of iron oxide $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ with coke (a form of carbon) to produce metallic iron and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This same reaction can NOT be done with alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ and carbon to make metallic Al and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Why not? Explain fully and give thermodynamic reasons for your answer. You may need to obtain further information from outside sources on the properties of the substances involved.

> [^0]:    *IUPAC has changed the standard pressure from 1 atm to 1 bar . Because 1 bar is equal to 0.987 atm , the differences in thermodynamic calculations are negligible except in work of very high precision. Many tables of thermodynamic data are still based on a standard pressure of 1 atm , so we use that pressure in this text.
