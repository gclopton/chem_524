b. Additional Course Materials: Journal publications will be made available through compass before class. Presentations will be made available through Canvas.

Access to Canvas: Required. Class materials will be made available through the course website via Canvas; thus, access to canvas will be required. An email notification will be sent along with new posts on Canvas. It is your responsibility to make sure your @illinois.edu email works properly. Basic knowledge of Canvas and the daily use of @illinois.edu e-mail is expected. You are expected to always bring a pocket calculator, paper, and pen to answer questions during class.

Sickness policy. We value your well-being in our class. If you are sick (such as tested positive for flu or Covid), you are encouraged to rest, stay home and away from others, which helps prevent the spreading of the virus to others in the classroom. Prof. Shen and TA Tyler are happy to help you make up the missed lectures (sharing notes etc.) so you don't fall behind. Please email us when you are sick at your earliest convenience.

We strictly follow CDC policy on respiratory virus including Covid, quoted below. CDC link: https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html). "When people get sick with a respiratory virus, the updated guidance recommends that they stay home and away from others. The recommendations suggest returning to normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, symptoms are improving overall, and if a fever was present, it has been gone without use of a fever-reducing medication.

Once people resume normal activities, they are encouraged to take additional prevention strategies for the next 5 days to curb disease spread, such as taking more steps for cleaner air, enhancing hygiene practices, wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance from others, and/or getting tested for respiratory viruses."

## Components for the Course Grade

Examinations: There will be two midterm examinations and one final examination. All exams will be in handwriting on the blue exam booklet that will be provided. The final exam will be cumulative.

Exam 1 and Exam 2 will be closed-book, but you can write down equations (no answer keys, no definitions) on one sheet of 8.5 inch by 11 inch paper. These two midterm exams will occur during scheduled class time from 11 am to 11:50 am. You will turn in your equation sheet along with your exam. The dates of Exams 1 and 2 are shown at the end of this syllabus.

The final examination will be open book during final exam time with date/time and location to be announced.

It is required to take every examination. A formal note from a Dean or Disability Services (see below) will be required for alternative arrangements in case you fail to take an examination. You are expected to complete all your exams alone without receiving or giving outside assistance.

Homework: Homework assignments will be provided to you periodically during the semester and will be announced in class and made available through canvas. All homework will be open-book and handwriting. You are welcome to work out homework assignments with your classmates, but you are responsible for providing answers based on your understanding of the material. Discuss knowledge but do not copy, plagiarize or incur in any type of academic dishonesty.

Homework will be assigned on Mondays and due before class begins on the following Monday. We will return your graded homework a week after. Homework (physical copies) should be turned in on time. Each late homework will be penalized and assigned a value of $50 \%$. To make sure that all students will receive timely feedback/be graded on time, late homework not turned in by class begins (i.e., 11 am ) on Wednesday of the same due week will not be accepted.

We will grade homework for completeness. For your answers to be considered complete, you need to answer every single question and perform work to solve a problem, use appropriate equations/concepts, and arrive at an answer that makes sense. Answer keys with grading rubrics to the homework will be uploaded to canvas on the same Monday when homework is returned to you; it is critical for you to check the answer keys to ensure you understand how to reach the correct answer.

In-class activities: We have a diverse range of in-class activities planned to reinforce your learning. Asking questions, sharing thoughts, discussing, and participating in in-class activities are strongly encouraged in class. Please be respectful when your peers speak out or ask/answer questions.
Visualization Lab: Electrochemistry can be abstract and difficult to understand without the proper tools and exercises. In order to complement the lecture, we will have a series of simulation activities, demonstrations, and manuscript discussions aimed at enhancing your experience with electrochemical terminology, experiments and systems. Preparation activities for the visualization lab will be provided as part of the homework; make sure your homework is handed in on time.

Final project. Students will form a group of $3-4$ students, brainstorm as a team (literature search etc.,) to finalize a topic that interests all team members. Then give a 10 min presentation. Details on the final project will be announced later during the semester.

## Course Policy

Academic Integrity: We will follow Articles $1-401$ through $1-406$ of the Student Code (beginning at https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/). This rule defines infractions of academic integrity, which include but are not limited to cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism. You are responsible for following these guidelines. If you have any questions about whether something would be an infraction, consult with the instructor before proceeding.

All students are expected to understand and follow the Student Code, especially article one (https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/). You are expected to complete all your exams alone without receiving or giving outside assistance. You are expected to be present in lectures and participate in inclass activities. Academic dishonesty (cheating) is grounds for failure of this course and academic discipline. Unethical conduct during examinations and in preparation of assignments is unacceptable and may result in disciplinary action.

If you use outside resources on any written assignment, you need to remember to cite all that is not your own in order to avoid plagiarism. In case of doubt on a homework assignment, you are encouraged
to attend the office hours to consult our TA, or even your classmates for help provided that it does not conflict with the code of conduct. You are not allowed to copy parts or the whole of a homework assignment or examination from your peers.

More details can also be found at: https://las.illinois.edu/academics/integrity
Expected Conduct in the Classroom-Providing a Positive Atmosphere Conductive to the Learning of All Students: Instructors are responsible for maintaining order and are strongly committed to providing a positive learning environment in the classroom. To create a positive learning environment for everyone, engaging in non-lecture related activities (e.g., watching games, checking social media, reading news, etc.) are prohibited during the lecture time. Because these activities can affect the learning of other students in the class.

All students must behave according to the code of conduct and guarantee a respectful environment for all peers and members of the University community as described in http://studentcode.illinois.edu/. Per student code of UIUC, "It is expected that students enrolled in the university will conduct themselves at all times in accordance with accepted principles of responsible citizenship and with due regard for the rights of others.", quoted from https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part2/1-201

Students whose behavior suggests the need for counseling or other assistance may be referred to their college office or University Counseling Services.

Request for Special Accommodations: To obtain disability-related adjustments and/or auxiliary aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon as possible. To contact DRES, you may visit 1207 S . Oak St., Champaign, call 217.333.4603, email disability@illinois.edu or go to the DRES website at http://disability.illinois.edu/.

Please also schedule a private meeting with Dr. Mei Shen to discuss your needs and requirements. All accommodations will try to be met once the student makes a request. Please note accommodations are not retroactive to the beginning of the semester but begin the day the student contacts their instructors with a current letter of accommodation from DRES.

## Commitment to create a welcoming and encouraging learning environment.

In Chem 524, we aim to create a welcoming learning environment where each student has a feeling of belonging. In such an environment, each student feels comfortable participating in the class discussion, asking questions, and sharing thoughts in a respectful manner. It takes action from us all to create a safe and inclusive environment.
